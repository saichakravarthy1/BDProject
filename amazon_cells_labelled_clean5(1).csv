0,try not to adjust the volume setting to avoid that I turn off the call button which is situated just below the volume adjustment knob.So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.
1,Good case Excellent value.
1,I thought Motorola made reliable products!.Battery for Motorola Razr.Great for the jawbone.
0,When I got this item it was larger than I thought It was the size of a small video game but bulky.(I looked for one that specifically said DCU 60 and said it supported USB 1 and 2.The first time it was turned on the screen display began to flicker.In some programs clicking it is the same as hitting the return key.Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!
1,The mic is great.
0,What happened was that I only had like 70 contacts but the SIM memory said I had 250 and that all my SIM memory was full.I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.
0,I bought five of thes for less than five dollars.If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.
1,I had the two year contract for this service.If you are Razr owner...you must have this!
0,Needless to say I wasted my money.
0,If money is no constraint then just go for it.Try texting fast with it...4.What a waste of money and time!.
1,If you buy this phone and have problems you need to contact customer service.This company will not give me back all of my money back because of their mistakes written in their review that said is made for the Dell Streak.And the sound quality is great.
1,It made sense.He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.
0,Others have complained of chipping paint but in the week I ve been using this it hasn t chipped yet.I m giving it a third try because I really want this phone to work properly it has such great potential to be an invaluable business tool.If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.
1,These are sealed packages by Motorola there is no way that Motorola would put the wrong charger with the wrong unit.It made the images look so grainy that you just could not appreciate the beautiful AMOLED screen anymore.Very good quality though
0,The design is very odd as the ear   clip   is not very comfortable at all.
1,Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.
0,the pda package runs $40 a month plus $40 a month for service.I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!
1,I only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when I did.Unfortunately I opened both so now I have (2).So Far So Good!.
1,Works great!.
0,It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.
0,I went on Motorola s website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again.
1,Also to adjust the call volume you have to be talking just push the over button to the left or right.I have patiently waited for a blackberry with Bluetooth and it came!I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!
0,After this month long reparte with the J.D.Not too bad I can still use the handset (Motorola E815) to switch between calls.Power button is TINY.I choose this because i liked the disign and i thought motorola made good products.The battery life is about 2 3x the life of the battery that it is replacing and as best I can remember about the same as the phone when new.My initial impression was the sound quality was good but the workmanship was cheap.The commercials are the most misleading.
1,The first one I washed in my jean s pocket.In general I could see phones having satellite or HD radio on them in the near future.7) Bluetooth capability.I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that s three days without charging.
0,Press the center button.3.I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.
1,I probably was prepared for the worst.!Unlike others here I have managed to scar the finish...(what can I say I m talented) but nothing that causes the phone to be unusable.Great Pocket PC   phone combination.
1,I d pay a few bucks more for the player with these included and you would probably increase your profit margins to boot.The on off switch is the antenna which pops in and out to turn the unit on or off.No such thing.I ve owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it s the best mobile phone I ve had.
0,I didn t think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.
0,People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.
0,Doesn t hold charge.
0,This is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible.
1,Since it consumes considerable amount of power it goes to standby mode quickly and then when you power it up it is very slow to get signals.This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.
0,I have missed more than 50  calls attended on this phone.It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.
0,I just bought this headset for use with an LG VX 8300.I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.
1,I bought these on sale at a tmobile store b c i needed a new bluetooth and thought   wow sterio bluetooth  .I bought this charger for my Pantech PN 215.I recently signed up for a two year contract through Amazon.I got the battery in the mail.Not for everyone.Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended
0,The synchronization did not work with the phone they advertised as being supported.You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.
1,It has kept up very well.
0,Really boxy sound and my past 4 headsets of the same kind broke without cause.TAKES MOVING IT ABOUT AFTERTRYING DIFFERENT SIZES.It s not bad but what do you expect for $3 or however much it is?I canceled a line.Not sure why they made it that way but it does have a pretty long charge (longer than my headphones).Poor Talk Time Performance.
1,But if you want a phone that has a good quality camera takes videos and etc.The case is great and works fine with the 680.
0,worthless product.
1,(I had used other headsets with wires and wasn t happy with any of them; this is the first headset that I ve found to be truly convenient.)It has a great camera thats 2MP and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.
0,Fast connection speed and solid connection   when your phone rings you need the headset to react quickly.I was not impressed by this product.
1,(The audio CD s is what I want for my  final product ).Nice headset priced right.
0,They can make anything.I use it for about 6 hours a day and have dropped the earpiece a couple times.The closest to a standard ring is the T Mobile advertisement jingle.I only hear garbage for audio.
1,It looks like a solid case with all the keys exposed.Verizon is a little faster but $49.95 a month.Excellent bluetooth headset.
1,It has all the features I want
0,I cannot review the remote s capabilities since it wouldn t work for this iHome we have.And so far I haven t found the vibe and then ring option which was available even through the side button of the motorola.3.Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.
0,AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.
1,This case seems well made.
0,Thank You... Almost perfect.... It s so much easier to carry a cable vs another mini brick for every device you need to charge in your laptop bag.Yes I still think this phone is ridiculas  especially for 100 dollars.Connected it to a Motorola Cliq running Gingerbread but the connection wasn t too strong and my conversations were difficult to maintain.Disappointed with battery.
0,Not loud enough and doesn t turn on like it should.
1,This is the first headset that gives acceptable sound quality both sending and receiving on my Treo 700P.good protection and does not make phone too bulky.
1,A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.
1,This is the second time I have purchased this because my little cousin grabbed and broke the first one.I don t have to charge my phone half as much as before.it lasted about six months.This phone is pretty sturdy and I ve never had any large problems with it.
1,I don t know if it s T Mobile though.I tried it on my phobe and it was still very bad.More bad than good.I love this thing!
1,Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.
0,And thas about it.It s not the perfect phone.Lucky....I guess.It also constantly repeats   Command not recognized....   or it would ask   Did you say?SolidGreat.And while you can shut off the flashing blue light you can t do so while you are already on a call.If not it displays the caller id info.5.So you can only control the positioning one dimensionally.My aim was to find a small sleek simple contemporary looking phone.This product did the trick came with all the necessary chargers and data cable needed to get the lg scoop connected to my computer.VERY DISAPPOINTED.
1,I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!
1,I bought this pretty much because of the Monster name.I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.
0,I checked the tracking info a couple of days after the order and saw that the company said my product had been delivered last month.Was a little surprised to find a 3 pin UK charger (with a cheap nasty adapter for US power outlets).The buttons for on and off are bad.
0,I have returned my chager to Motorolla under warranty two times.All contacts are combined.It really is OEM.Essentially you can forget Microsoft s tech support.
1,Wish I d played with it the day it arrived.I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool.
1,These headphones were a great find   and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I ve made in the last several years   seriously.
0,Buy a different phone   but not this.
0,You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.
0,with my Treo 700w.It is a very snug fit to snug I might add.I have been with Cingular 400 Roll over plans for 3 years now.This product is not well suited for my LG Vue I am still looking for a better armband.So if I can get 2gb of memory in a storage card for under $30 why couldn t they have increased the memory?but was not compatible.. Did not work with my verizon phone and had to ship it back.The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone s front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.
0,A week later after I activated it it suddenly died.
1,It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.
1,Great for iPODs too.
1,And my wife also uses this unit as I bought her one.It might say  Plantronics  in the ad but there aren t any marking of the manufacturer.This device is great in several situations:1.)
0,Mic Doesn t work.
0,Don t buy for KRZR K1m.Maybe it s just the Creative product that cuses the problem?Mine has a sync button.They shipped to me a Monster RadioPlay 250.Since I bought this I rarely use the headset to talk with.logitech replaced it with this one 12 06.Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.
1,Great choice!
1,I have purchesed a few hand free ear pieces in the last 2 years.Nice docking station for home or work.
1,Surprising to get at such price.I reluctantly went about preparing my new keyboard for a return.This is a beautiful phone.
1,Love this product.
0,Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.
1,I live 4 miles outside city limits.As soon as I plugged them into my iPhone I received an error message that the phone was not charging.It s big and bulky and seems too heavy to hold on with the latch on the back of the unit.About an hour into the trip I heard him scream that the cord was getting hot and pulled over to see what was going on.This is a great little item.
1,i have other palm products and liked them.First let me just say to those who bash this phove because of T Mobile STOP!Points for truth in advertising though as it really is a Danger Side Pouch  emphasis on DANGER!I love this phone  It is very handy and has a lot of features .
0,I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!
1,Clip was so limp the battery wouldn t stay in the phone.I wear it everyday and it holds up very well.
0,Not a good bargain.
1,Well packaged arrived on time and works as intended.
0,at first i was happy because it wasn t some stupid looking free phones without a camera and stuff.on my other phone i used speed dial.Works every time.. I use these USB chargers to charge my Blackberry and my Drift camera.PDA but no Communications.Otherwise the best option you have is the earbuds that come with the phone.The battery runs down quickly.
0,This item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use.
1,The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.
1,This phone works great.
0,Great product.Caveat emptor.The vendor sent me a replacement headset after discovering the first one didn t work and the replacement didn t work either.I agree with one of the other reviewers that it feels flimsy at first you will be nervous about keeping it in your pocket.I cut these pads to put under the rubber furniture pads between them and the floow and no more slipping.Big difference.The construction of the headsets is poor.
1,Don t bump into things.Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!
1,This keyboard really makes the BlackBerry much more useful!The phone loads super!
0,All I asked for was the service they said they would provide.I need to find the headset!!!I always have problems with ear bud size!!!.Now I can put them in this case and put the case in my purse and when I want to pull my phone out it s all together.For a product that costs as much as this one does I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.
1,My Motorola V197 fits just as it should into the case.There is some distortion when I use the unit and people on the other end have complained about similar interference too.Great clip!.I should have read the other reviews for this item before I bought it.so for the phone I give 5 thumbs up.Most likely.The only remedy we have for non functioning headsets is replacement if the headset is within the one year warranty.Low power battery.The image of this Lithium Ion Battery shown on the website is that of the original battery that come w  Nokia phone.After contacting Cingular [again] they informed me that my information was now in the system but the SIM would not respond.Made very sturdy.
1,Worked great!.
0,Upon my return to the US the only compensation provided by T Mobile was a replacement unit.I can use it a few times then it won t work.I set the box up but the instructions say it needs 15 feet of VERTICAL clearance between the base unit and the antenna.I ve put it away in a drawer I don t plan to use it much.I d stay away from these guys.The ear buds only play music in one ear.
0,Dont waste your money...
1,I use them on a Windows XP PC and have had no issues once the software was installed.Paired up with a Bluetooth headset I rarely have to touch the phone itself for actual phone calls; when I do it s easy to use.This will force the unit to run off the batteries (which come pre charged).Will order from them again!
0,No problem.If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.
0,Thank you so much.I was correct.I found this product to be waaay too big.
1,Best I ve found so far .... I ve tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.
0,I m very disappointed with my decision.
1,Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.
0,Maybe you ll have better luck but I m going to swap these two for something that works more like a telephone (can you hear me now!)helps you to throw that charger away and not use it at all.Try getting a 172x220 animated GIF under 100K; its very very limiting.I purchased this headset when my daughter was born.Should have been easier.Buyer Beware you could flush money right down the toilet.
1,This doesn t seem to be a new battery as they described on the site.For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling I recommend you try the version with   Noise Cancelling.  I wanted to get this phone because it has has walkie talkie and ringtones and it looks fine.So I want this phone.Now the IPOD works like new and holds a charge for hours.This would minimize background noise.Bug in the Samsung e315 phone.I wish I had bought a motorola phone.Definitely a bargain.
1,I have no problem with signal though.The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.
0,I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.
1,Pros: Good camera   very nice pictures  also has cool styles like black and white and more.
0,It s not comfy and everyone I talk to says they can t hear me when I use it.... Oh well...That s a huge design flaw (unless I m not using it correctly which I don t think is the case).
1,I bought the jabra c120 stereo earbuds because i thought it would work for my phone but it don t.But the BlueAnt Supertooth Light was not what it was cracked up to be.I never had signals going into buildings with AT&T; and the Nokia 6310i (more a fault of AT&T; rather than the Nokia).They claim to have faster service but there were browser limitations that made it seem no faster to me that the IPAQ.I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.
0,The camera although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.
0,I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.
1,Sound quality on both end is excellent I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.
1,the included adapter as originally planned because they sound better and are more comfortable to wear for extended period of time.So you end up paying 3 weeks of cellular charges with out using the services.There are a few spots around town where my calls get dropped when I use my cellular phone while driving in the car.This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.
1,its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.
1,This model Bluetooth was the first model I ever owned...that was 3 years ago.The JAB C510 does not work with the IPhone 4 and I know the C250 does because I have one already.I ordered this product about a month ago.......didnt get it wrote a not so great review.However I feel the T610 has an easier user interface and is able to screen calls.The first RAZR was fine for the first 72 hrs.All in all this phone is about the same as that one.Great product fast shipping!.
1,(i) You cannot display SIM card memory OR phone memory.Absolutely great.
1,It is a simple phone that does as good job.The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.
0,The buttons are very well laid out.5.It s   manner mode.  i got this phone around the end of may and i m completely unhappy with it.
1,This is exasperating.3.But I just wish it had better internal memory.It is very comfortable on the ear.
1,It has been a winner for us.
1,This is my first bluetooth headset.I use a Nokia 6010 as my primary phone.After several weeks of frustration    and really wanting this headset to work    I gave up and returned it.It s alot smaller lighter and WAY better.Low down dirty battery time.)Setup couldn t have been simpler.
1,I ve tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I ve found that fits my ear comfortably.
0,GOOD answer!Could not get strong enough signal.
1,The MP3 player in theory is nice but the headphone jack on the phone is proprietary so I can only use their headphones unless I pick up an adapter.Will it ever work?.It works and was cheap what more can I say.Wanting to go wireless I read reviews and felt the CS55 would fit my needs.Iam glad to get adapter s like this for my old Sony phone.Iam very pleased with my purchase.
0,I would recommend buying a screen protector with it as well.This battery did not come in a NOKIA package and the black paint on the Nokia Hologram Logo is worn???This is THE unit to purchase.Bad Quality.
1,Gets the job done.
1,Great audio!.
0,I emailed them about the problem and they sent me the instructions to reset the phone within minutes.I got the metallic blue cover and it was shipped without additional shipping charges (thank you!).Protects go.Basically the service was very bad.
0,It doesn t help that the button is positioned so my thumb always wants to push it.On the positive side it s a light phone with good quality sound.And with rumors flying around that they re going to be bought out in the near future I will be considering switching to Sprint.The charger I ordered does not work!It worked out doors at work and most importantly in my condo.Was delivered on the 26th.I have no plans of switching carriers anytime soon.(I cannot believe how many people are jawing away on a cell phone while pumping gas.BARGAINCELL.it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.
1,I no longer carry the charger on business trips I use this cable and charge my Treo 600 using a laptop instead.I ve only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but I really like it.
0,My solution was to fit the hook under the outside of my ear which pulls the bud down into my ear and holds it in place.The cover is too short for the Motorola V3i cell phone.The BT headset was such a disapoinment.
1,It is so small and you don t even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.
1,Samsung E105   T Mobile (5 5).The accompanied software is almost brilliant.
1,The first problem was there was no caller id data on my external screen.I primarily use my Palm Treo for making calls and using organizer functions.Purchased at an AT&T; store on Friday along with my iPhone.Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.
1,!I definitly recommend!!
0,Disappointed.STATIC AND TROUBLE PAIRING.This unit does the job.Buyer  Be Very Careful!!!!!.
0,As soon as I am in a calm and unhurried mood I will try that option and update this review.I am currently fighting w  nokia so I can have them send me a new piece.I do know that if the phone is resting on a spot and isnt touched the connection remains.I have not tried the other   new   battery but it was completely dead when it arrived.The new Blackberry has accomplished what they set out to do from the begining.i used this product on a Blackjack II screen that was covered in cloudy patches of scratches.I use it for work and when I have to call a client back because my headset doesn t work that does not look good.Supposedly it s being pitched to the corporate market as Windows oriented but it s botched for that purpose.great for your camera etc .I paired it with my Blackberry 8100 and it was simple and straightforward.The keyboard ships with a device holder at the top but I pulled that off in the first week and have not looked back.The magnetic latch at front of cover serves 2 purposes   holds cover in place and cuts power to the screen and keyboard when cover is closed (magic).The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.
1,Charge time is less than an hour but that steep of a descent in talk time is kind of harsh.Sound was very scratchy when plugged in.This product requires you to constantly change the station to play your IPOD anywhere while driving.Very good stuff for the price.
1,Then one day I went to use them and the reciever crapped out.Stylish sleek ergonomic2.great product.I do however try to put it back in it s cradle as much as possible during the day to prevent battery run down.I m using it with Skype Photo Booth and as a headset for Itunes and other apps that would normally use the speakers but I need private listening.Here s the major problem and hopefully mine was defective.Product was what I wanted just did not hold up.My headset works just peachy keen.
0,I went over to tombile and picked up the cheapest flip phone they had at the time.The bad news is with AppleI have a very small canon pocket camera that I bring with me when I bike.I can t hear you!!!.Heard it s a common problem for v220.In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.
1,i think my problem might have been the wireless home network.There are several menu options you must go through before you can get to your address book when texting.I used it for a week.I have used Palm m515 for years and it recently died and I thought that was heavy ( m515 was almost 4.5oz)I have used it for 3 days only.Voice recognition is tremendous!
0,(I think this is the difference between TeleNav capable versions though)7.What a waste.
0,The HS850 is larger than the H700 series and does not have a USB charger.Not kidding.During several different 2 minute calls I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.
0,The problem I found was that the clips leg expands way to little to slide on a mans  belt   or any normal leather belt for that matter.They found out that by the number code that was on the CD.I can t recommend the phone for the average user but would recommend it for someone who likes cutting edge equipment and doesn t mind a few hassles.I was not happy with this item.
0,very disappointed.
0,Now it s been four weeks.I hoped that maybe I just received a bad phone so I returned it for another.Whether I ll be staying with AT&T; is the main question.This device works well.The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.
1,I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I m glad I did.
0,What a waste of time!
0,However I could barely understand him.Backup usb cable is added bonus.Worth the money.When it works though it is a great bluetooth headset and works really well with my Nokia 6233 and has great sound.Its reception is very very poor.
0,Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.
0,Cord is too short if you move your jaws (talk) good luck keeping the thing in your ear.I have an ipod video and sandisk mp3 player and both sound great.After 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden.
0,They both have the same problem.I carry a spare in my car and one in my office.There is no such thing as perfection...but the Q comes pretty darned close!good but not so much.I Was Hoping for More.
0,It s really cool!After a couple weeks of hearing complaints I returned the 700 and purchased the Plantronics 510.I used it on the vent and on day two or three after I received it it would start moving to the sides when I turned.Why the box says   Desktop Charger   is beyond me.Audio Quality is poor very poor.
1,After a week I called again.I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!
1,I ve still not seen a phone with an interface close to this one.Sound is great and the controls are simple.Lower per minute rates (esp.Does not work with iPhone 3GS.The software does not recognize my phone.It looks like this phone is geared towards the young professional under 30 crowd.First the Ja Blah errr Jabra Bt350 is a good headset if you do not know much about bluetooth.Lacks most common connection.Much handier then just a headseat.thought case was all leather but much of it was clear plastic.Nice Job By All.I know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn t work well.Well this one works great.
0,sticky pad review.(Wish I had realized there were new comments from Dell Axim owners.I ve bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.
1,Motorola H500.Only by reading reviews was I able to clear up my issues.It took almost a month to get resolved but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered.One advantage to this one piece design is the superior sturdiness it affords.I sold my Discovery 650 and upgraded to the 655 because I thought the DSP would cut the noise in the car.I don t need bells and whistles and I don t want my phone to do more than let me talk with my friends and family.So when the info on their site was bad the charger did not work and guess who carries the bag?SPEAK UP?!?  Gripe   you cannot edit tasks with this phone you can only change the title.Post Its would have more stickiness.This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.
1,lost phone.Nice quality build unlike some cheap s*** out there.
1,Just What I needed.So you are going to back up another cable 100 percent?This item is fantastic and works perfectly!
1,Works perfectly if you set the phone down don t touch it and don t go over any bumps.Eventhough this holster does hold the phone I ve found it very difficult to get the phone in and out of the holster.or LG s Chocolate.In short if you re just looking for a flashy stylish phone the LG Chocolate fits the bill nicely.And I just love the colors!
1,When it is fully charged the blue light goes out.The earbuds would fall if you don t wear them over the ear.The volume does not get high enough to hear well.3rd.W810i is just SUPERB.
0,The max volume of the V600 is the mid level volume of the Razr.However these replacement batteries have proven perfect.But now I realize what I ve been missing out on.The major drawback I like the keypad a lot much better than my previous phone s teeny little buttons.All I can do is whine on the Internet so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.
1,Cute phone a few glitches.The other colored skins hide the beauty of the phone.The SLVR is the best phone I ve ever had and I m very happy with it.What can you do about this?All it takes is a pocket knife or any other utensil suitable for taking a bit of plastic off the top tongue.already i ve had problems with the phone   freezing up.  I needed a hands free device to comply with the new California driving law.Plantronics does ask that you return the broken headset in exchange but still it s a huge savings to handle a replacement this way.Sony car charger.I took it home to charge it and it wouldn t accept a charge.I am a vibrate only guy.It holds a charge much better.Its very compact and easily fits in your pocket purse or briefcase.great replacement.Verizon Techs have admitted to me that the antennae in the handset just doesn t pick up well.I purchased the phone and returned it.Great charger.
0,Buyer Beware!.Best Bluetooth.  I say:CACA!This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again.The Samsung A 950 is not a good choice to make despite what others are saying.Initially there was some concern as to whether or not the Flexicase would interfere with thumbing but no problems with that so far.It was in a plain white box with bot a T603 and T605 label and the unit was clearly marked T603.I m glad I rejected the opinion of the reviewer who said it was too bulky and that it stuck out too far.It is a mystery each day how the phone will respond to the owner s touch.Does not work with Blackberry Pearl.Plus the anti noise technology doesn t really work.The phone itself is good but certain features make it VERY annoying.Dont do it.These made the WEP 200 bearable to wear all day.The item arrived fast  within 6 days   and worked fine.Total frustration & a waste of money.In that respect it is a great phone.I have enjoyed this product every much.I couldn t hear anyone and they couldn t hear me it wound up in the trash.This ribbon cable in turn activates the screen when the phone is slid open (or closes is when slid shut).This phone sucks!.The extended battery is wonderful and the price was great!!!Nothing by dead silence.It keeps turning off!.It was heavily distorted through the audio system.It s a phone with a PDA or vice verce.Click Text Message    .9.  This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.
1,None of the Jabras or Motorolas come close to the performance and comfort of the 510.Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.
0,Don t Bother with this Seller.Sound quality is clear and loud even in loud environments like airports.This phone is no exception.What Customer service?.for the second time!I still maintain that monkeys shouldn t make headphones we just obviously don t share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.
1,I ll try it for a couple more days before shipping it back.On the Siemens Panasonic and Vtech though audio performance was marginal  it sounded like you were across the room.I had read the reviews and just hoped I didn t get a duff one like some of the others.If I could do it over I would probably not buy this cover and just carry the player as is.The only thing it did is make my wife question my thinking!Great Value.
0,That s impressive.Since that is where the mike is... it picks it up loudly.Doesn t work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.
1,Not sure the reasoning....but am happy with the product and excellent service!I bought this recorder module for the purpose of recording classes at a music symposium I attended this month.Hope this helps you as well.And now I can put *any* sim card in the phone not just Cingular AT&T.The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics.
0,I ve had this for about a year.Compatibility with this phone although more advanced than the K1 and the T637 is terrible.Works like a charm with the HTC Touch.doesn t last long.
0,None of those phones had covers like mine!I had to use my friend s t mobile phone to call in late.high priced plans.One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.
1,EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.
0,Thank you for wasting my money.
0,It doesn t do that.Better than my old Plantronics.I called them again for solution.A Step Backward.How can that be?The audio quality is poor.
1,The iGo chargers and tips are really great.
1,I ve had to reinstall this software dozens of times.The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.
1,But since the phone is so thin & the release tab is fairly strong I can t get the phone off with one hand unless I struggle with it.One thing I would recommend.I ve read where some guys figured out a way i just havent tried to rig it up yet.good but not the best.I handled it with care but it was time for battery change.When I ordered these I expected something of much lower quality.I sent them an e mail back saying that although I would love a free Bluetooth headset I would prefer the product that I was looking for.when shopping at Amazon for Iphone accessories on check out i was informed that a screen protector could not be posted to Australia?I can t figure out why people are talking about bad reception.None of this flimsy crap like the Sony Erricson s have.Superb Phone on a Great Network.
1,I connected my wife s bluetooth Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.
0,I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g) and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.
0,I had an older model Samsung that worked much better and my new RAZR is even better!It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.
0,If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you!
0,Don t buy this product.
0,The phone will slide into the holster but the phone clip on the holster does not secure or even touch the phone.I ve had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.
1,The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.
0,I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side I really abhor it.
0,I ve heard this is just an issue with hard drive based iPods.If your iPod uses a hard drive and you plan on long recording don t bother with this.When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired I of course wanted to keep my number.When I turn the volume up the highest it will go it does not help.I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.
1,Incredible!.
0,Design Flaw?.
1,T mobiles customer service is a nice change coming from Nextel!I have had this phone for about ~1 year.The earlpiece does not lay flat against my ear.I was wearing the headset on my left side and holding the phone with my left hand   STATIC!!!!Great phone!.
0,Ah well live and learn...It is nice for backing up phone numbers and data in phone.I plugged the charger into the first phone that was waiting to be returned and the same thing happened   Not Charging   msg appeared.Waste of 13 bucks.
0,But when I check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then I m lost.
0,I like the fact that they do not interfere with glasses but be careful not to drop them.The replacement died in a few weeks.
1,Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..
1,car charger.Overall I am very impressed with this and the service provided.My contract is up at this point; when this one dies I ll be getting something else.No better than the worn out battery I was replacing.Sound quality was excellent but there were a few crackles.Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.
0,Dissapointing but not unusual for Motorola.. I have had this phone since August 2005.I have to buy a new Palm or organizer for me.I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.
0,Works fine with my USB cable and fits my travel phone obviating the need to carry yet another charger.Not impressed.
1,I have been searching for a few months with no luck.You can t beat the price.Light weight I hardly notice it is there.
1,You ll love how thin it is.
0,Bad Choice.
0,The pleather case doesn t fit.
0,This pretty much works as advertised.I strongly advise against signing up through Amazon.THIS PHONE IS A LEMON.useless phone simply deaf.
1,The detachable clip is a bit bulky but you get used to it and it does come off.The agreement between Motorola iTunes and Cingular is to sell phones in the U.S.It has pretty good range although it seems to be very defined.The color is even prettier than I thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp.
1,Functional and an Improvement.I can t upgrade to a new phone that would use these because I d have to buy an entire another unit not just the tips Why?All in all I think it was a good investment.
0,It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.
1,The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.
0,The headset is loud when I pump up the handsfree volume on the phone and crank up the volume on the headset too.Does not look like the picture.At first I thought I was doing something wrong but how can one mess up pushing the on button.Phone Holder.Manual very confusing to a new user.Battery lasts only a few hours.
1,Which is it?That problem has an easy solution   if the unit does not turn on or off on the first attempt   try again until it does.great headset very impressed   H500.
1,The   1.2   mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7.
1,S105 E105 X475 and now the X495.I ve had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.
1,Good transmit audio.
0,It s a series of   hello hello?You can also download games and programs to make the phone more functional.The constant exhortation to buy more (now!)This item protected the phone great but was bulky and caused some of the buttons not to function correctly on the phone.I have owned two LG phones including the VX7000 and I had problems with both phones powering down for no reason.We re BlueAnt fans now and I bought a lot of good will along with this gift.....I haven t tried it with a cell phone but that s where the two modes are supposed to work simultaneously.We are sending it back.
0,I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.
0,If you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means.
1,The only reason I gave it 4 5 stars is because I would like it to go down a little farther on the front top and a little higher on the front bottom.the video looks good on the phone but only medioker on computer.It s worse than nothing at all.Treo Battery.As soon as I got it I plugged in my phone and it takes a second but starts to boot up and says phone charging.&lt;WARNING> It doesn t work with Skype &lt;WARNING>I also bought this headseat thinking it would work between iTunes and Skype.Great Range Poor Sound Quality.Great price also!
1,The range is very decent I ve been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception sound quality issues.
1,I really like it but have made several observationsBut all in all it works with my Xbox 360 and for only a little over $2.00 I guess you can t ask for too much.Sometimes I forget I have it on my ear.Also you want the connection to your phone to be stable.Works great for Samsung WEP200.fast service.
1,RMA ACCESSORIES send this product to phones that are not compatible with it and it creates a bad image for the productThankfully its within the time frame of the satisifaction and VZ is changing me out to a different phone altogether.The earpiece volume is very low10.I have used iGo chargers for over a year and this little contraption has made an already great idea even better.(I have observed for myself how tough those puppies are.)I would highly recommend this.
1,Easily clip to something (I use the clip to keep the iPhone on my seatbelt while I m driving for easy access).So after reading reviews and advice from sales people this seemed like the best option for me.After using it for a few days I was not impressed.you have to aim it at the grill on the right hand side.After buying the new LG Chocolate I found that I needed to buy a new car charger for it.The horizontal placement is much more comfortable than the original case s vertical storage.A minor point is that it   connects   to my phone (a Palm Treo 700p) when a call is placed.I would recommend this.
0,The stereo headset lets you listen to music and talk on the phone (has microphone built in).Works fine.In the past 3 months the phone crashes at least once a week.The power button blends too well to the touch.I also didn t like the   on   button it felt like it would crack with use.
0,The included car charger makes this a snap.Really Nice Headphones But .I had a problem activating one phone because it arrived set to the wrong public system selection.WORST PHONE EVER.
1,It s sleek.I m still infatuated with this phone.
0,The directions defy the law of physics.3.It didn t just DIE it started making calls on its own.I am not making this up.All to no avail.This crappy headset produced constant static unless the phone was 1 2  from the headset.I called to cancelled and charged me $112 and change.Freezes frequently4.
0,Inside Secret.If you give this phone to a teen your next bill could be monstrous from the ridiculously priced customization.6.can t they make solar powered ones?2.Volume control is kinda impossible.Claimed outstanding noise reduction and great battery life + a fancy looking charger.I tried to take the headset back to cartoys but they wouldn t accept the return without the manual.Summary:1) Don t buy motorola.A cover that goes on the front and back of the phone!.I received the T305 on 11 26 09 charged it overnight and it has been in use ever since.The transmitter that came with my unit was faulty and only broadcast the right channel   I also got no reply from BlueAnt s tech support.It s kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it s embarrassing how child like the company is.
1,Simple lightweight and great fit.
0,I have gone through a number of earhooks as they seem to snap just when you need them the most.2.Well made ut difficult to close.. The strap did NOT use Velcro to close.http:  www.amazon.com gp product B0009H7QKQ ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis works great but does not come with a synch button like the original.All in all I d expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.
0,If you press and hold the UP volume button it sets the mute on.My fiancee and I bought a pair of these at the same time about a year ago.i90c torture.T Mobile sells a great device that meets or exceeds all my expectations until it breaks.I thought   pay the extra $$ for a genuine Motorola product.  The clip rotates 360 degrees which helps and the entire inside display screen is protected.The differences are mainly in comfort style and ease of use.There s a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.
1,She has reported no issues with it not working with her Nook.These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.
1,I usually don t like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn t mess up my hair.
0,I m a bit disappointed.
0,Yeah she s not getting it.I waited almost 3 weeks and I got itBut It is not suitable for nexus 4The film is really smaller than screen of nexus 4.I have had this phone for over a year now and I will tell you its not that great.
0,I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).
0,Since my i870 battery goes dead in like 1 1 2 with the extended batter pack I have to plug it in to charge.Read before you buy a Treo 700p.Even if the headphones break (I stepped on mine) they can be replaced and still used with the converter microphone.It s okay and useable but if the camera had been a higher resolution this would have been a 5 star device.Finally is T mobile service.I have a V3x which took several updates before it found the phone.Super Star Blue Tooth.The battery is completely useless to me.
0,Me and my wife each bought the phone with Verizon s   New after 2   plan and chose this one.What a big waste of time.
0,Don t waste your $$$ on this one.
1,Great sound and service.
1,You ll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works.Sony cell phone battery purchase.This is bad for obvious reasons but it s also good in that it makes it more visible.Really pleased with this product so far.
1,We have not had a problem with it in our cars.The phone could not sustain a call at my work nor at my house.I do wish the phone had bluetooth and modem capabilities however.The voice dialing features built into the phone work wonderfully.One of my favorite purchases ever.
1,I m going to keep this one short and simpledirectly from your computer.11.I shut off the bluetooth on my cell phone and my laptop but the reception never improved.I had been unable to use since my charger had been ruined.And is my daughter s constant excuse for not answering when I call her.Genuine Sanyo battery.Find a phone and a plan you can like with another carrier.I wish there was an option for better than perfect service as this company deserves it.Razr V3c Replacement Battery.I for one switched from T mobil to Cingular mainly to get my hands on a black razr.I recently purchased this and the best I can say is that it is a so so device.best bluetooth on the market.
1,Too little!!!!Not to shabby for a POS.CAN I GET A HALLELUJAH?Don t be fooled by the pictures though    putting the Axim upright downsn t fly.Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!
1,Sound is loud and the eargels helps it stay put even with shaking my head around.I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute.
0,Do not make the same mistake as me.
0,Their only response was that they had contacted USPS to find my package.The only reason i did it was because I still have my 400 min.When it is closed it still acts as if it were open allowing it to drain all day   which makes it useless in the evening.Big Disappointment with calendar sync.
0,It comes with three ear tips none of which fit my ears well at all.Needless to say I was going to cancel my service and rejoin Sprint but a rep convinced me to try the i850 for another 14 day trial period.the phone was unusable and was not new.
0,Worst Customer Service Ever.
0,Too much hassle for my liking.The audio quality was acceptable and pairing was easy.We bought a replacement charger on eBay and it didn t fit.The first thing I realized is that the cs50 wouldn t work with my cordless phone.No additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever.
0,Initially I thought it was lame to carry around a keyboard and PDA.Good design but poor quality.It completely covers up the external jack... another example of designing something without using the actual product.I can call my relatives FOR FREE in the UK drinking a Capuccino at Starbucks using their free wi fi access.Don t be fooled by the link for compatible phones which advises you &quot;All phones with 2.5mm jack.&quot; Not true!!Sent the phone back in.As it turns out I m not.Fits Like A Glove!.While there is no chance of the iPhone falling out of it the holder does come detached from the vent.It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.
1,I ve dropped it a few times and it doesn t show damage anywhere not in the screen or the functions.Plus I was concerned my new phone would slip from my hands as well as the belt clip.I have no problems with this unit.On one set I could only get sound out of one ear bud no matter what I did.Worth every penny.
1,Allows me to synchronize my contact with Outlook & use my phone as a modem.Yes you can hear very well with this product But This Item should have come with a roll of Duct tape and a tube of superglue.The big problem that I see is not being able to break it down into individual songs.choice cell phone battery.This is the bluetooth I have ever tried and I have tried them all.Excellent wallet type phone case.
1,Wrong Starter kit.. This starter kit was not for the Samsung i 500.Nice and loud.I got this thing because I was tired of the cords hanging around my neck.The iPhone cannot watch it??Nice headphones for the price and they work great!
0,Internet is excrutiatingly slow.
1,So unfortunately I don t know if this headset works or not.Of course they want you to buy a larger denomination card so they make this just good for only 15 days.The only option available is the T Mobile melody that you hear on their commercials.If you listen to music I recommend headphones.Update June 2011   I m still using this phone and it s still awesome.Essentially I paid Technocel[price]to damage my phone.My primary interest in purchasing a new case for my Galaxy Nexus was to get one with cut outs around the buttons.I have been through 5 of these phones already and every one has a terrible echo.Good on delivery bad on advertising....Is what my computer said...I don t have time to be shipping things back and fourth I d like my purchases to last when I buy them.It is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.
1,It s fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable.
1,My wife chose the Samsung because it was the smaller of the two phones.We live about 4 miles from downtown in a semi fringe area.O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.
1,Thanks for the Updates Motorola!.It s very attractive and appears to be of good quality.
1,Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I m stuck with it.Well I have had this phone for about 4 days and I am planning on returning it as soon as the replacement battery for my scp 6200 arrives.Cash in your daughter s college fund and buy one today!I love all the features and form factor.
0,This product had a strong rubber petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
0,LOL It is textured metal so it not too slick.Highway robbery!!!But they do not understand about business relationships and how to assist the customer.They told me they don t run into many problems at all with this phone!I ve called them from multiple phones all land lines and they still say they can t hear you.This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel.poor quality and service.
0,No battery.You have to use your phone s mute feature.There s no audio alert when the headset connects with anything.i bought this cell for my mom as she said she wanted a simple phone.. this phone does the job its nothing fancy but it works.The cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary.
1,Great Earpiece.
1,Superb speaker for the price.. This product is just superb the price for this quality is insane.Excellent hands free tool.
1,Great for using with your home stereo.
1,Good product   incredible value.
1,the shiny piano black look shows finger prints and smuges.Only had this a month but it s worked flawlessly so far.
1,My advice is to only get this if you have the razr otherwise forget it.It actually fits into the port on my iPod but not my vission m. Of course my iPod won t take a charge from it though.I am really frustrated.Works great.
0,Needless to say I will probably never by another Belkin product again.Absolutel junk.
0,I would recommend buying a different manufacturer s phone but if you re stuck on buying a Samsung go with one of the Blackjack s.The Monster actually overpowered it!!!This is my first blue tooth headset.The earpiece is also easier to get on than my last plantronics set and can be done with one hand.THAT one didn t work either.
1,One real crappy phone except for the looks.. Hi  recently bought 2 of these phones from the Amazon store.No problems.I ve had others that just didnt work the same and paid a lot more!!!!Battery life is real good.
0,Returned 8 hours later.
1,I noticed a slight buzzing sound coming from the charger and it got really hot.It s a great item.
0,Don t waste your money!.
1,Love this headset!
0,Most annoying is the 4 emails I ve written to the supplier that were ignored.This has caused problems as I only get one to two bars in my home.It follows very nicely with my   casually play with settings until I have to read manual   attitude with electronics.I have use this holster for more than a year.I don t know if it s because I use it on my Razr phone but there is no echo or any problems at all.Not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it.
1,(Callers go straight to voicemail).BlueAnt BA SUPERTOOTH3 Bluetooth Handsfree (Black)Connection with mobile phone almost instantaneous speaker works well.Download this line up the PDA like that blah blah blah inferior keys.Worked perfectly!
0,Nice but heavy.Well it does not fit any of the mobile products I have including my laption cell phone and MP3 player.When I got home I tried to download them from the phone with no success (no I didn t read the manual very well the first day!).Volume could be a bit higher but I do use the earhook going to try eargels and will get back to you on that.Unreliable   I m giving up.
1,The i90c boasts a sleek new look without sacrificing functionality.Typing in a phone number to call is slow.I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.
0,cameras on cell phones have gotten crazy and the public has gotten even crazier with its expectations.Avoid this one if you can.
1,Works great long charge.Jabra might be phasing them out but this is a nice headset for the reasons above.This pouch is well designed allowing the antenna to protrude and permitting the blinking signal light to be visible when the cover is closed.You can t go wrong.Order another from a different web site and it worked.Amazon is a good place to buy these as we could not find them in traditional stores like Best Buy et al.Replace Item.Phone is also very hard to open without using two handsI will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone I have ever owned.Its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear.I bought the scala 500 for my treo 650 (Cingular) phone and was rather disappointed.Have had this phone for a year but didn t use it much (got a better phone then switched back when it was stolen).Reversible plug works great.
0,I wasted my little money with this earpiece.
1,The features are extremely simple to use and learn so I found myself using the unit with ease in no time.Did not work with my phone because my phone had a smaller plug and vendor did not show good pic or descriptionIf you re a former Palm PDA user you ll hate this as a PDA (and probably as a phone as well).Very good phone.
1,It is small enough to put in your pocket or purse.I had no idea that they made this in different sizes.I don t remember anything that showed me the product was new which is what I wanted.Best of all is the rotating feature very helpful.
1,This was my first blue tooth that I had ever purchased.Comfort for our whole family.
1,Good product good seller.
1,I love this bluetooth!
0,First of all it doesn t wear well.
1,I polished for about 2 minutes and most of the scratches were gone.The charging was complete in less than an hour and should fully charge from   empty   within 2 hours.It is a small phone so it doesn t take a lot of room.Don t move you phone or the connection will be broken.I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.
1,I did this morning but I have to pay the postage.It cost me like $200.I have had my Motorola Razor for a few years now and I would go through a new case every four or five months.This DLO case is a great horizontal case.Go to Control Panel on the N8002.Using HS850 with Moto E815 and loving it.Luckily I was able to return it and get another one because it was within 30 days.The T610 Phone gets 5 stars T Mobile gets 4 only for lack of coverage.H700 Blue Tooth.I believe this is a knock off product even thought they use the Motorola model number and logo on the pouch.Inexpensive and Functional.I m the original poster Denise who reviewed this item and I m re writing my original review.This looks like it would be a really great screen protector but it is too big for the L7C s screen.The second phone does not receive any signal at all.There is no manufacture date on this new battery so it s probably just as old as my other one.The quality of the sound of the earpiece speaker the speakerphone and the ringer are simply the worst I have ever encountered.The keys are large enough to type easily and it is a full 5 row keyboard.I had to go to my Verizon store to get a NEW one with this month s date code.Amazon WHY would you do this?I got it because it was so small and adorable.
1,Great phone!.
0,one worked for one conversation only when I applied pressure to the jack after that nothing worked.I think the camera works fine.I wouldn t recommend buying this product.
0,Leather Fanny Pack.I would purchase a different brand next time.When this did not fix it they said they will ship the new headset and I needed to return the old headset within 30 days for the exchange to be free.There are other cards that are much better.This is a great little thing to keep in your car and it is easy to change it so that it works in an ordinary older top loading cassette player.I d be done with that seller once and for all.Piece of Junk.
0,Poorly contstruct hinge.
1,This item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems
1,Sought it out on a friend s recommendation.Didn t look exactly   new   as it was in a little ziplock bag.Great Phone.
0,There s practically nothing to grip.conversations on my cell now without dropping calls.My family is very hard on earpieces and we ve broken units from several manufacturers including Bluespoon Logitech Motorola Plantronics and Scala.I switched from Cingular because of the ridiculous surcharges and improper billing I was constantly faced with.It does increase safety in the car.I was also told that prolonged use of this battery will ultimately damage the phone.well lucky my girl is going to get a new phone next may so i don t think it will be another samsung cheap phone.This battery is for that phone and I am so glad to find it available on Amazon.Wound up getting a replacement battery from Radio Shack which is probably what I should have done from the start the price was competitive.I have vista so this is no good.Great phone.The computer had to be shut off and restarted each time but when it s updated it works terrific!Not so good if you are in a crowded noisy or windy location.Select  Generic 105 key PC 4.Very nice but buggy device.I find that it works fine if you follow the instructions.Dropped calls   I ve owned three top of the line Sanyo phones for Sprint.However for iPhone users beware no bluetooth headsets work for music due to the iphone software.I bought this because I had just bought a Motorola RAZR phone and had trouble hearing the phone.Great looking not fuctional they need to add support to the bottom of the case so it doesn t slip off.It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty.Don t buy it.
1,Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective.Excellent Phone.
0,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.
1,However the LG6000 camera is really really bad especially at night.I m glad to be using a legacey device because I know you can t find ipod batteries this cheap!Nokia N800 will display  Think Outside Keyboard 11.The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.
1,The company where I work has people that abuse and break theirs leather cases.This is hands down the best phone I ve ever had.
1,Even though my primary use is a phone I still need it to be a PDA organizer.The shipping was quick.Works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.
1,The flap will pop open.I need to get another case.I kept the Bose for the office.I purchased the Motorola S805 basically out of sheer desperation.This one works and was priced right.
0,basically a pro is that it s a cellphone3.Oh yeah It seemed as if one of them was already used or at least tried.With this tiny fix you will definitely have the best looking best performing and best fitting bluetooth headset out there.And where s the ZOOM???I tried several other inexpensive phones but the clarity was not there.If I wanted to be tethered to a wire I would just use a land line...Four months later (yesterday) headset number two died in the same way number one gave up the ghost.Customer service was terrible.
0,I was promised credit minus a 10  restocking fee IF AND ONLY IF I wrote a review favorable to the seller which I did.Lost this one on a ride at Disney World.Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.
0,If you need a quick & cheap replacement battery this would be the way to go.The sound on my end is not that great either though I m willing to trade that off if my caller says it sounds ok.The ad for it sounded good.Well I lost the phone yesterday and believe it or not I was SOOO happy to lose it.And the user interface really makes a lot of sense once you ve figured out all the shortcuts and stuff.So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended) I had the old number switched to my new number.There s a joint between the main body of the unit and the panel with the buttons on it which has come apart on all three units I ve tried.I tried the charger and USB cable on 3 different Samsung phones.Sending it back.
1,Now I know that I made a wise decision.
1,The one thing that is annoying which other buyers have noticed is a tendency to reset itself.It s a wire that you plug into the back of your car stereo.Someone shouldve invented this sooner.
1,Good price.
1,Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.
1,I still find the processor to be annoying and T Mobile s coverage is not the best.Sound quality is poor as well...the headsets will go back to vzw..The only complaint is that the unit is uncomfortable on my ear after a wearing for a short time.Alltel has apparently not disabled this to the extent that others have.A different iGo recharger model ($70 $100) for laptops is available and it will also power other electronic gadgets.I received it quickly and it works great!!
1,It is the same cable included in the kit but does not include the software.Has been working great.
0,decent phone but gets very poor reception.As many people complained I found this headset s microphone was very weak.
0,Hello Moto?...Suggestion.My 5 year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.
0,It s small ergonomically easy to use and aesthetically pleasing.I suspect the seller was selling it as new but it is used and they won t take it back.They do not care about the consumer one bit.
1,It s what it says.i would recommend u get it .i am getting my next fone in april and i am looking at the LG chocolate and the EnV.The Box is no good without software.The phone does charge but that is all.This is a good battery and it got here really fast.
0,The instruction manual is lacking.
1,This morning I flipped open the mic and put the thing on my ear.If all you want to do is talk and text this phone is for you.keep it cool!Really brand new when i got it.Great little phone although pricey.Random next track etc. all from the factory radio controls!Bet they won t ever offer this item as described foe $14.99.Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.
1,Well soon to find out it was this stupid cord not my ipod!They only allow you to return it if you want another of the same in return.Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.
0,No static on my end and no one I ever talk to has any complaints either.If you have a T 509 it just doesn t work.. the only thing it does is charge my phone which i really don t need it to do.The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.
0,I suspect that the battery was reconditioned rather than new.I recall reading another headset s package (Plantronics or Motorola?)When I returned it for exchange the saleperson said that s typical of this headset and only from Motorola.It s uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).
1,Not only did it quit working properly after one week.Makes it quite reasonable to pay 25 cents minute for your first 10 minutes of the day and just 10 cents minute thereafter.I tried 4 phones and felt noise in all the phones.The one I bought had noise level quite high and was problem with talking on phone.I wasted so much money going through so many different chargers!We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.
1,Nokia Data Cables.This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.
0,I want my money back.
1,Nice bluetooth headset.I love this device.
1,Product arrived without a battery   make sure you order one separately and don t take anything for granted!It can go anywhere just like up phone or iPOD!Range is at least as advertised.The problem is that since this is a slider phone these clips make it impossible to actually open the fun.Sport Lanyard.cellphone accessories.(Turns out the travel mouse is on major    couple month    back order.)Sorry to say    but this is the only product from Amazon that I have recieved over the years that didn t work.I am also very happy with the price.
0,The fast forward and rewind capabilities are not implemented in the iPhone so this will not work using any headphones.I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.
0,The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.
1,I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.
0,Old dog etc.Doesn t fit Blackberry 8330.NEXTEL BOOST PHONE.Seems Like a Used Battery.Each time I called I was told it was being investigated with their highest priority.I have 2 3 bars on my cell phone when I am home but you cant not hear anything.
1,good item low price.
0,The question you may be asking is why did I not address this with the shipper I was going to today .... now I haveSo I was looking for more of a case which the phone could slip in and out off for my next case... this has worked out well so far.However the riingtones are not the best and neither are the games.
0,The plug did not work very well.
0,Again it s not a games machine.The UI is easy and intuitive to use and I ve grown fond of the wheel for doing menu selections.Besides the blue is cool so why hid it.I feel it is too wide.AMAZON SUCKS.
0,It lists many phones that this charger is compatible with but I saw no listing for Samsung A900.They sent me a new phone since it was under warranty.not doing its purpose.Rip off     Over charge shipping.
1,VERY comfortable.
1,This phone is not a 5 star phone as most Sanyo phones are.The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.
1,Data cable for Razor 3VM.I dont care enough to go get new ones.Less problems.I m considering the super glue solution.My head is rather large and they haven t hurt my ears or head at all.This one like the first one works OK when new but gets worse as you use it.I really wanted to like this phone.It has cushions to protect your phone device so it does not get scratched.The reception is excellent!
1,I have a Nokia E61i phone.I saw that this new vendor was selling them for under $70.It fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days.
1,I should have listened to other reviews.No more wires and a little more practicality.very clear quality sound and you don t have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.
0,I actually borrowed someones Cardo 500 and it works withmy Treo 700 just fine.1. long lasting battery (you don t have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.
0,IT THE BEST  Recently I have played with Sony Ericson PalmOne Nokia and Samsung phones and must say the Motorola sounds best.Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.
0,Very disappointing.
0,i think it would be easier to have your palm piolt stolen as well.It was an inexpensive piece but I would still have expected better quality.
0,Paid somebody to do the update nd it was worth then before.I bought this phone with a prepaid plan from hsn.com.Wrong color; wrong back cutouts for Verizon Pearl.TThe different positions are a bonus too.I have a Motorola 9q.wire deattached agian.It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.
1,Yeah the price was killing before but now its pretty affordable.When I tried to recharge my phone I got a message tellingme it was an unauthorized charger.Excellent sound quality.
0,and acts the part of a premium phone.Very little.Was not happy.
0,A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!
1,New Battery works great in phone.
0,The car charger does so I guess it s not a total loss.Worst customer service.
1,Pieces stick out and don t allow a sung fit.THIS PHONE IS NOT GREAT!I ve dropped my phone more times than I can say even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).
0,Every chocolate owner should try this item.This wireless headset is a wonderful solution for hands free cell phone communication.Reception is terrible and full of static.
1,Good audio quality.
1,Does what it is supposed to do!.This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.
0,At the default setting with moderate vulume setting wearing full face helmets the wife and I could communicate with no problem up to 45mph.I was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal.
0,For this item and price should be Leather.I did install the latest AT&T; ROM update and my phone lasts me almost 2 days (without e mail and internet use).It does feel a bit bulky to me.Were JERKS on the phone.
1,Fast & Simple.This LG head set is a very durable piece of equipment that doubles as a 2.5 to 3.5 converter.It was OK but not what I expected.Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.
1,Comfortable Nice Range Good Battery Life.
0,Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.
0,I purchased this headset for a family member on my calling plan.Stylus replacement.Excellent starter wireless headset.
0,The loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
0,Clarity is second to none and there is no echo.It still has very poor quality in windy environments but I don t know of a set that doesn t.Now the bad.When I search Nokia s website there inn t a NOKIA BLD 3R battery only a NOKIA BLD 3.My family has four of these phones on a two year plan purchased new.It attracted every piece of dust or dirt it came in contact with.The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.
0,First off the reception sucks I have never had more than 2 bars ever.
0,The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
1,It reverses the polarity.Now this may work for certain cell phones headsets.I was considering t mobile but my friend michelle told me she had it for a year hated it switched to cingular and absolutely loves it.Great design but be careful when first using it with an Extended Battery.After messing around with it for 2 3 weeks I finally just sent the whole thing back.Keeps auto reverse.The microphone also works well but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.
1,Nice design and quality.
0,It does what it s suppossed to without a lot of fuss.I have net searched for a LOONG time for a decent looking classy affordable case.Also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down.
1,Wish on off was just a separate switch.I was easily able to infrared beam my contacts from both my Nokia 8290 and my Palm Compatible Sony CLIE.I love HP and always have but there are too many shortcomings.Pros:1.It is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission.
0,The 665 stays connected more frequently but this high end headset sounds like crap on the Treo.bad fit way too big.
1,Once you have your footage simply dump it onto your computer via the included USB cable.And then the phone goes into   emergency mode   and we re unable to make any calls at all.I need tweezers to remove it.It definitely was not as good as my S11.
1,I started using it with the one installed by the manufacturer and then tried another only to find the second gave me more volume and clarity.awesome device.
0,Waste of money.
1,I had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product.
1,Love This Phone.
1,Also it s light enough that you immediately forget about it until you need it.I bought 2 of these (one for me and the other for my sister); we both didn t like them.This clip was designed to slide into the mounting bracket of the Nokia hands free car kit   CARK 120.I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I ve got it I couldn t be happier.
0,I ll be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason.
1,Very ethnical!!!I do not understand the differences between the different ear hoops.Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.
1,ActiveSync is not reliable like HotSync.Battery life is also great!
0,(Which I do not recommend it drastically increased the pressure in my ear canal and it felt like my ear drum was going to pop.The worst phone I ve ever had.... Only had it for a few months.
0,It s my first Nokia.Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.
0,I like the internet sharing but if there s wifi I will use my laptop instead of sharing.This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.
1,received the plantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset that was said to be new but only the ear plugs were new.After many call and after three months they changed my number.Protects the phone on all sides.
0,This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.
1,belt holster.If the phone is already juiced up a bit charger will work fine.There s also a smidge of space on either side which I like.Not the highest quality sound (slight hiss or white noise with the volume up fairly high) but perfectly fine for everyday casual use.Wish I had bought more as backups!Clear Skype Calls Long Battery Life Long Range.
0,The padded vinyl case included should protect while traveling.Quick and Cheap.Did even last 24 hours.Good price Not as pictured.It was just all my speed dials and call group contacts were gone from the Phone memory.Soyo technology sucks.
1,The   squeege   they give you is a piece of cardboard that doesn t really do anything.I called Belkin for a replacement as the package says it has a lifetime guarantee.Great Hands Free Device.
1,extra fail safe buttons.There are no cut outs for the buttons and also no cut outs at the corners of the casing.What happened?But if you buy one it won t work.you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display very cool.
0,there you were a shimmering artifact of technological revolution.Same problem as others have mentioned.
1,After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.
1,Magical Help.
0,So I m in the market for bluetooth headphones once more.Also the multimedia phones came out with the ability to play MP3s from the memory card which this phone can not do.The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.
0,Let s be clearonly one side works although it says it will work for this phone.In control panel click  Bluetooth  (can click Pair if using OS 2008)5.Overall happy with charger.I bought this VM Nokia 3 weeks ago.Poor sound quality.
1,Use it all the Time.But the other funny thing is you can t cancel the original order because the operation keeps timing out when contacting Amazon s servers again.The best phone in market :).
1,Guess I m going to an earpiece which was what I wanted to avoid in the car.It worked very well.
1,The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.
1,I have just laminated one of my receipts that said   lifetime warranty   so the lazer print wont fade and the receipt stays fresh.The original review with its criticism still stands but I recently tried the Sony Erriccson w300i and that has made me appreciate this phone more.Exactly what I wanted.
0,My advice is to find a seller that will include both in home and in car chargers.Happy hunting.The picture resolution is far below what other comparably priced phones are offering today.
1,This is a great deal.
1,Excellent product I am very satisfied with the purchase.
1,I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.
1,not like the photo   and silence from the seller.Better than you d expect.
0,Good design but doesn t work with Nokia 3650.Expensive.Full user opinionYes it s expensive but this gadget does it all.Screen s big and easy to read.Does what it needs to.I purchased this headset so I could use it with my Motorola v551.Using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear.
1,The only negative is that the phone will not fit the non swivel holster any more.After that you re on your own.I have a BlackBerry Curve 8320 and got this keyboard to use with the device.The whole point of a smartphone is to be a great phone first.This is no biggie for me since I never browse the web using my phoneHow on Earth can you be charged the full price that you pay every month for only 20 extra minutes that you NEVER agreed to in the first place.It is loud enough through the case.Great product and price.
1,Sounds good reasonably priced and effective Its that simple !
0,Then you have to pair from the computer to the device.Still Waiting...... I m sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!
0,I was not able to get a battery for my old cell phone through Verizon or anyone else.what a disappointment
1,The complete internet plan is much more affordable than what I had with Cingular.The K9 was a fine phone but I wanted to get something that was a little smaller and would more easily fit in my pocket.Very prompt service.
1,The worst part is that I have already lost money in shipping that I can t get back.Excellent product for the price.
1,Very pleased with this headset.
0,A crutial piece of plastic broke off of it as soon as I plugged it into my phone and then remained there thus creating a new project of removing it.So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended) I had the old number switched to my new number.don t waste your money and time.
1,I especially love the long battery life.
0,If I let it sit for a while it works again for another 30 40 minutes and then fails again.mp3 ringtones.Glad to say that it fits snugly and is not too bulky.Exceptional Value.It s so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.
1,Works great.
1,The existing combo phone pda s TREO 600 650 etc.Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.
0,Power off itself and can t boot it back.Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off!If you are in a totally quiet area it is fine.I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.
0,I thought that this would be a nice alternative to the   Star Trek   headsets that everyone is wearing but it is not.I had read all the reviews from other people that they break.If you wear glasses then this is the headset for you.I ll be looking for a new earpiece.
1,It cuts off High frequency range almost completely.I highly recommend this device to everyone!
1,It is however larger than most if not all of the bluetooth headsets out on the current market.It s less   geeky   than some headsets.3.Jawbone Era is awesome too!
0,This phone is consistent with the quality of phones I ve received from Cingular.My old battery no longer held a charge so I found these.Not the snazziest smartphone any more it still works nicely for me.Thanks Amazon.Good Phone.Once i got the phone activated I haven t had any problems.This product is no more difficult or easy to use than other adapters.We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week   but still lasts longer than thereplacement
0,Do I need to change any settings ?With a regular phone you could rest your finger on the button to hold it steady and then press without much movement of the phone.There are three earpieces so you can find the one that fits your ear the best.The things that it s not that I likeI do need to worry about the line limit or accident when walking.After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.
1,Since it was inexpensive I m throwing it away rather try to get my money back.I have used several phone in two years but this one is the best.
1,I almost thought the plastic tools that come with the battery were going to break.An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.
0,The battery life should be long enough that like your phone you never have to turn it off at all if you don t care to.)9.In terms of functionality I could only wish it could send DTMF tones while in a call from the phonebook.This is the first phone I ve had that has been so cheaply made.
0,I loved that feature on my StarTac.Att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.
0,A cellphone must first and foremost do what it s supposed to do.The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.
1,You can call me a fool for not running all the traps but as a prospective consumer be wary of this platform as it still has many many kinks.Meanwhile you ve lost a call.It felt comfortable but I couldn t even charge it to use it.Great Bluetooth!.The case fits this cell really well.Price is good too.
0,Don t make the same mistake I did.
0,Verizon s menu is not intuitive.I am back with Cincinnati Bell with no contract.I have been asked not to use my cellphone by Cordless phone users because it causes major static disruption)Sorry to be so negative.Cingular doesn t sell the   real deal   anymore (it was comfortable and very easy to get the phone in and out of) so I m going to keep looking.Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.
1,I m using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.
0,I ve had this phone for a year with T Mobile.Also the area where my unit broke).  I m not too fond of the magnetic strap.
1,Better spent buying extra long extension for regular headphones.There has to be a better way than bluetooth.Overall I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.
1,every thing on phone work perfectly she like it.
0,Sure it is a fun phone but try getting some signal!you really wont find a bad phone these days.So despite the positive aspects mentioned below I cannot rate it any better.Another note about this phone s appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model.
1,Make sure  Bluetooth  is checked and  Visible  is Checked6.IT S REALLY EASY.
1,My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.
1,Fantastic earphones.
1,It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.
0,My coworker had one I tried out and I liked it so much I bought one.A BIT OUTDATED.. I bought it to try and rescue data and pictures from an old broken nokia phone.Low Quality.
1,Suspended phone not supported by Verizon.I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.
1,But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I ve had before.
0,Sure it fits the phone and I m sure it works as a battery but my phone no longer fits in the clip in belt holster that I use 24 7.If you want to keep the look and style of the Samsung Galaxy Note this is the case you are looking for!I m pretty tired of giving up incompatible accessories when I change phones or providers.It fits quite comfortably and sound quality seems fine.Warning   Stay away.
0,I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.
1,Battery life is the bad thing about this phone if you re use to 4 7 day charges on Nokia phones.Awsome Device Works Great!!.
0,I used to talk on it for 1   1 1 2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.
0,If you don t find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.
0,Very Displeased.
0,I downloaded a big set of songs onto it right from my PC in about 5 minutes.Sound quality is great 90  of the time.This phone has all the features of the RAZR and video capture.You will have to sit a lot closer to the console and television then you like to.I might have gotten a defect but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.
0,(cases were dusty)They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.
1,That is more what I would expect from a new battery.Eventually it started to charge a bit but then stopped within 2 minutes every time it started.TL;DR versionIt does not work.Restored my phone to like new performance.
1,I was at the Sprint store and felt pressured to pick a phone the salesman reassured me that Sayno is great.I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX 10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q go figure.
1,I searched the Internet and found this one to be the best value.
0,You have to pull them out a little to get them on your head.Does not fit.
1,I chose black.Very happy with this product.
1,Expensive But Worth It.The screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.
0,service and product price.If I were working and on a conference call I had to keep the phone on the same side of my body as the ear the headset was in.A micro USB connector version would be nice as well although the tiny Motorola Mini Micro cable works.If you don t want these things this phone is your best bet for the money.The static persists at any distance from my cell phone including having the cell phone in my hand as I walk around the house.There s really nothing bad I can say about this headset.
1,i m glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasn t high priced.
1,I can wear them for hours without feeling fatigue.The color is rather nice too.Krusell Genuine Leather Case Classic with Multidapt Sony Ericsson W810iWorks great with the phone.Portable and it works.
1,II will never buy anything else.It has been a wonderful addition to myDragon Natually Speaking.I used it in my RV.basement with bad cell phone reception.This product did not help increase recption at all.(You must be home to sign for them and that can be a problem if you work!)5.Appears to be a quick to market first gen product.So it s more user friendly.My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive but performance is great.
0,I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi fi and noticed that it only had 20   left in the morning.
0,There are neutral colors for those that prefer something not so obvious.If you are in a somewhat rural area as I am you might want to consider something other than the Cyclops.CAVEAT EMPTOR   This thing buzzes like a bumblebee on steroids.The mice  end  came apart after a week.Unfortunately with my car s stereo I had no other options so I decided to bite the bullet and buy a quality transmitter.Think hard about buying this the I pod phones are excellentChained to a land line when on call?I ve also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.
0,Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.
1,Timely shipment and quality product.
1,I have gone through two of these phones.Then they told me it doesn t happen.Nice solid keyboard.
1,I can walk about 30 feet away from the phone and still be able to talk.Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.
0,I do a bit of remote PC support and liked the idea of utilizing a hands free bluetooth set that I could sync with my Motorola Razr.I find myself having to hit the keys with my fingernails.Great product   installation was easy   the only problem was that I had to use alcohol to remove sticker residue from both inner and outer guards.We own a towing business and he is on his phone ALOT.Horrible phone.
0,The reason this rating is low is because this wasn t the item I needed.I have been through 3 cases so far and either they re too bulky or too flimsy but this case offers protection without bulking up the phone.Here s why:1.BT50 battery junk!.
1,Now that I ve grown up a bit I ve gone thru another 5 or 6 Bluetooths and this was probably the bottom of the line for all of them.We would recommend these to others.
0,They do stay put when you are moving around alot like cleaning house and such.Cant get the software to work with my computer.
0,It is an 880 mAH rated battery part no SNN5762A.Disappointed!.
0,My previous Samsung phone had excellent reception so I figured this would be the same.poor voice clarity.
1,No no  and no.I understand the item is inexpensive but come on... 3 bad chargers.The battery works great!
0,UNFORTUNATLY LOOKS ARE NOT EVERYTHING.No buyers remorse on this one!.
0,Much better than any other ones I have purchased.Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.
0,I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.
1,My review of the Nokia 8801.Looks great and is strong.  
1,I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now and I am pretty happy with it.
0,Does not work with BB Curve 8330 with OS 4.3 or above.The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.
0,Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.
1,While I think it is a great phone it is not perfect.The included earpieces did not offer an option that felt secure to the ear either.Great software for Motorolas.
1,It broke quite soon.I bought the RDX 150 because the description said for PC and Mac!I unplugged it from the charger and plugged it in again several times and finally got it to turn on.The delivery was on time.
1,Who wants to talk on the phone while they re riding anyways?Very easy to use.
0,The integrated on off and microphone feature is a little odd but not terrible.Extra Power.Uncomfortable In the Ear Don t use with LG VX9900 (EnV).
0,I really wanted a case to protect the screen and didn t want to use a stick on protector because of past bad luck with them.If you are a man then this is not the phone for you.Can go all day without charging for the most part    and I use my phone a lot!Not as good as I had hoped.. This was the exact item I had been looking for and could not find in the stores where I was shopping.Using it for a headset is great also but the mic is too sensitive.Worked.. I m always dropping the phone and its great too cover up the window on the phone too.As it turns out the   flex   arm is really just a piece of metal surrounded by a plastic sheath.They also said   We don t support Blackberry.  T mobile not so mobile.Ordered this for my white iPhone.The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.
1,I have bought about 10 of them and the reason I need so many is that I am super hard on them.In some ways it is kind of offensive.At least they reversed the charge because I had two months free trial!10 30 04    As an update I have now had the phone for almost a year.It holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under long wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.
0,So if you ve just pressed 9 different digits you have to sit there and hold clear for ten seconds before you can utilize the volume control.I d like to return it.
1,So I ran to Sprint to replace it and the V3 caught my eye.you fulfilled so very many of my childhood aspirations especially my dream of becoming a rogue international spy.The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don t expect any problems.
0,10 cent for text message free to recieve.All I had to do to make a call was dial the two digits and the pound key.Once thats over though I am gone for sure and I will NEVER return to T mobile.Blinking red indicates a missed call message waiting or no signal.Verizon s bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.
1,After charging overnight these batteries work great.
1,I m not sure it is being manufactured the same and if it is really a samsung product the quality has changed drastically.You won t regret it!
1,I love this phone!.
0,I don t even get service in my own apartment with T mobile and I am trapped in a contract with them until July 08.beating it?A Disappointment.
0,It doesn t.I didn t want a big bulky case and I got just what I wanted.Waste your money if you want but I am speaking from experience.I bought this item $15.You will hear the unit hum vibrate as it should.Its not user friendly.
0,Battery limited(if you talk alot) Not uncomfortable.pretty d*mn good.Not great but better than most.Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.
0,great phone when bought through cingular.If you have small ears that don t stick out from your head then this might not be the one for you.it is a smaller phone but i expected that when i got it.an AM radio station that is not quite on frequency?Plus I actually got this phone cuz I thought lost old one.Having owned two of the Body Glove Earglove Headsets I would not purchase another one.I don t know if this happens with all phones just mine.its always one thing after another.And it allows me to take important calls and make them while I am driving without breaking the law and with safety in mind.I wish it were a little smaller around my ear   the only reason I gave it 4 stars.Works very well with ASUS EP 121 Slate.The customer service for Cingular is the same as other companies I have tried Sprint and Verizon.Slight scratches on it.Nice fit no range.So I returned it.Otherwise I am very pleased with it.it s.... the carrying case is ok.!Muhammad Ali HasanThe calendar and reminders are useful4.Then I exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem.
0,I m soo organized!.I ve used several different headsets over time and none beats the Plantronics!However there s quite some stupid designs in there.This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.
1,This PDA rocks.
1,It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop camera cellphone and excels in those roles.
1,I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price!
1,I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.
0,The same amount I am getting on an original equipment two and one half year old battery.Thats kinda important.It s a thicker material so I found it easier to apply and it went on without any bubbles on my first try.Pretty piece of junk.
0,It is not compatable with my son s 8gb 4th gen ipod nano.I understand that a later firmware release fixes this which Jabra can install if you ship it back to them.Unfortunately I donated it to charity once I got this phone so I can t use it.Plug was the wrong size.
1,Works as described.
0,When I have them on I find it doesn t fit behind them and if I turn my head it s possible the thing will go flying.Save your money.... I ve had this item for 11 months now.
0,Bad Purchase.
1,already broke!.WELL IM SATISFIED.
1,I have this paired with a Cingular 2125 AND a Jabra A210.The bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a NYC commuter.
1,This battery is an excellent bargain!
0,Great Idea But Does Not Work :(.I did not experience any of the dropped call problems or crashes but maybe I got lucky with the unit I bought.For $3.08 including shipping I can t complain.Defective crap.
0,I would go with a name brand product and pay more for better quality.The plug has to be placed in just the right position in the cigarette lighter or else it won t charge.I would have given no star if I was able.
1,I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.
0,This product is really inappropriate.samsung blue tooth ear head set.You can wear this headset without the tips and I ve actually gotten to prefer not having an ear tip inside my ear.I bought this product for my husband and when he is using it I cannot hear a word he is saying!This is my first bluetooth headset though so my comparison is only to expectation.The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing.
0,Tracfone s service is not bad.I would not recommend this item to anyone.
0,Plus you can t beat the price!At first I had trouble achieving contact but eventually I was able to keep the power continuous.The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.
1,great...no problems at all!.
0,As an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens.
1,Yes I m a grown man 6  so I don t think this is unique to me.Don t get surprised if you phone gets 3 weeks to arrive as it happened in my case.Their calling plan page seems to be confusing.kinda mad about that.This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.
0,I purchased this in the hope of adding some substance to my Note.You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.
1,You may find a slighty better sounding headset.Mine feels secure after doing this and is comfortable to wear for long periods of time and I can hardly tell it s there.I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day even when the phone was turned off.My brother recommended this item because he has one.It s Windows Mobile...Windows uses menus.The sound clarity is way better than the Treo as is the screen.The same thing happened in July with 2   new   batteries that went dead in minutes.I put this product on my dashboard and immediately all four edges curled up.My colleague and I thought   Finally!When I went back to just using the phone everyone could hear me sans static.When LOCKED you are ONLY allow to use the phone with the provider s SIM chip.I have called people only to have them hang up on me because they cannot hear me talking.Their email:Unfortunately we do not have a driver for that device currently.The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.
1,It s been one of the most frustrating experiences I ve ever had with a piece of technology.The construction and comfort of this headset are fine.So I got one (also from Plantronics) that cost a little more and it works great.I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well  it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.
1,Makes it a little hard to be discreet in a meeting.I use in 18 wheller.very good product well made.
1,Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.
1,The result is that it turns itself off frequently during a call cutting off the speaker for a second or two.I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.
1,Have been using it for 4 weeks and it is broken already.These were light weight felt great and when I got stereo they sounded wonderful.not sure whether to get this or not?.I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall I am very excited to have this source.
1,I got this version from I O Gear as the version that I lost was so terrific.The phone is sturdy and waterproof.
0,In some cases they are slightly off and in others they are completely off.I thought it was great for the first two minutes.Your phone sounds great in stereo or at least with both ears hearing the same stuff.The screen is a bit washed out in high light.3.I hope I save one poor soul from this phone.The Sony Ericsson battery lasted for about 12 hours and then I d have to charge it.This phone fit the bill perfectly.I didn t give it 5 stars because customer service with cingular needs so much improvement.I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.
0,The clarity is unequal to any cellular phone on the Market.*Charging is slow.My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)
1,Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!
1,I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.
1,The battery lasts a really long time was easy to set up and has good sound quality and reception even in the car.Nice try but not good enough for the price Motorola ia asking.I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.
1,Works great!.
0,I m pleased over the first month of use.REALLY UGLY.
0,The gels fit well.I was in two minds when I was getting a phone around Nov.horrible had to switch 3 times.
1,I m sure I would also be happy with the Monoural CS361N.Hope this helps!The noise shield is incrediable.
0,Within the 10 day period that I had this phone I had like 15 dropped calls.Not just sitting still on the phone.so go on ahead and buy it.this is not a phone.I burned through 2 sheets just trying to apply them.No real improvement.
1,Razr Battery   Good buy.
1,We had a lot of experience with older types of permanent magnet windgenerators and spruce (wood) blades.Go with the RAZR or with the LG VX8100.Keep up the good work Amazon!!
0,for being so big one would think it would have to be strong as well but that is not the case with this clip.I took it back got another one that one lasted about 18 hours same problem.Not pretty.The PLT 510 is completely different.Have been using it for a few months and have no problems at all.Don t buy this if you want to use the clip.And Palm s desktop software can surprise you with a feature that automatically deletes most of your old calendar entries.A case MADE for the Razr.I ve been using this charger for my Sprint Centro 690 for the past 6 months after my Palm charger died.I use the headset on my way to work on my way home and when I m out and about on weekends   about 4 hours a day; and I have yet to charge it.They refuse to refund or replace.
0,It is also very flimsy.I have purchased 4.Unfortunately it s easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.
0,So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.
1,Great case and price!
0,finally i decided to get this phone.The A210 is paired by means of a stylus pressing down a depressed switch on the body of the unit.The price from Amazon was well below retail and the unit has a sleek polished look.All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.
1,I never got it.. The seller says they did not get paid and Amazon say they paid them on the 15th of May and its the 31st.BUT...The eargels unclip too easily when in a pocket bag or ESPECIALLY when in the pocket clip charger.Could be better.I ordered this charger from BargainCell and received it in 3 days as advertised.Bluetooth range is good   a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch.
1,I am constantly complimented on it and people are always curious about it.Small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place.
1,I purchased the carrying to reduce the wear and tear not to mention help keep me from loosing my 2nd H700 bluetooth headset.The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.
0,Motorola v551.none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.
1,I strap the Sirius SL 100 to my upper arm and hit the weights.I am glad I purchased it.
0,I ve missed numerous calls because of this reason.
0,I have adjusted it a number of times to the highest setting and it is about half the volume of other bluetooth ear pieces I have.Perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when I use this.
0,No more holding the button down just the right way for just the right length of time to turn it on!Every move you make getting out of the car sitting down bending over the phone is inching its way out of the case.Don t buy this product.
0,They don t allow for more than 100 songs (again because of the U.S.I see no replacement plug for sale.old technology that still works just fine!sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone.
1,I exchanged it for a Sanyo PM8200 and its much better.Sometimes the device would actually be off (which it did on its it own) and I would have to turn it on.No shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch NOTHING!I couldn t be more happier with my new one for the Droid.
0,But I will grant the possibility that it was simply a defective charger.When it is replaced onto the headset the plastic breaks.I even upgraded the firmware on the headset...no change that I could tell...I will review the phone and then review the MP3 player s problems and good points.THE PHONE:My previous phone was a Motorola V330    the blue one.Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset.The only issuesWorst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.
0,If you are a teenager this phone may be good for you.I put my old battery back in my phone.Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.
0,Both worked fine with either phone even recognized the voice commands stored on both phones.The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.
1,I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better.
1,After using this headset even the bass on my car speakers is enough to bother me now and they re just normal car speakers.No documentation or any other information was included.I bought this exact same item from someone a few months ago.As of now I can call manually and receive calls but heaven forbid it goes into voicemail.I love the camera it s really pretty good quality.
1,Could have been Better!.Thank you for such great service.
1,That left a bad taste in regards to amazon.The item came quickly and it was exactly what I wanted and in the time I needed.Its a total package.
1,I wasn t able to find the web site for the manufacturer.The seller is very understanding and patient I would definitely buy from them again.
0,I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular AT&T; and inform them of this practice.
0,There is a longer painstaking way to do it.hopefully before i retiredIt s AGGRAVATING!
1,Not worth the price in my opinion.The service is very reliable now that Cingular has spent money on over 47000 cell sites in America.I m a technically savvy person but I can tell I m in for hours of valuable time trying to get this to work.I just hope they fix the bugs.Great product for the price!.
1,Why show this one?I was embarrassed when they took it out of the box for a first look.I have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use
1,Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!
0,None of it works just don t buy it.
0,The scam is that if you run all of the cable and mount everything you will not want to remove everything for return.I know i sould stuck up but it is true.They replaced the infuriating proprietary NOKIA POP PORT combination USB and HEADPHONE access port with separate STANDARD USB and HEADPHONE jacks.Muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire s insert was poorly super glued and slid off.
0,The holes don t match up perfectly but it s good enough.I m very active so I want a headset that I can use to listen to tunes while working out or running.Most of the time people can t hear me.I was fooled twice.I used the original HS820 for years which was a great headset.Please dont waste your money.
1,My interior is a bit noisy but it seems to work great in quiet rooms but not really anywhere else.Sound quality is always pretty bad and I get complaints from the other side also.I have a Platronics since before I got this and that works great.I believe that it is common sense that when you have a phone of this build you obviously must be a lot more careful and aware with it.This comes with a bunch of phone adapters but not a micro usb the most common for cell phones so I actually haven t been able to use it yet  ve had a selection oh phones since this one and they didnt compare so as of now I m waiting on my new nokia 3220.press once for this twice for that hold 3 secs for the other etc.)That didn t solve my cell coverage problem but it did give me a working phone inside my home so I m happy.All in all I m quite satisfied with this purchase.
0,the charger actually charged my phone.The actual battery model # did NOT match the image that I saw for this battery.Well it looks like nokia have been trying out this theory with handsfree headphone kits.When compared in size to a RAZR it is about the same length closed double the length opened and about a RAZR and a half thick.I called reseller   unlockedcellphonekings   they told me sorry 90 days has passed nothing we can do.If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking this isn t it.
0,Common problems includeIt has to be kept too close to the phone and has too much noise in it.Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.
0,I m getting a new case!Also I can walk around my apt and even check my mail and still have a strong signal!!Disapointing Results.
0,Cumbersome design.
1,Great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!
1,The sellers did not respond.We bought this set also to give it a shot.Not impressed... Contemplating taking back.. I will be honest.Didn t feel like buying a unit priced higher than my phone :).Great Product.
0,decent pouch but very very bad clip.works with iPhone 3G OS 3.0.I have to go through the Treo menus to get it to pair again.this one works with my hp ipaq and motorola razor at the same time ipaq for my business and rzr for my personal phone.Button rattles.It s A PIECE OF CRAP!
0,To address this problem I picked up a Palm PDA.Not the best phone out there.... I ve had this phone for about a year and I have not been pleased with its service.Exactly what I needed for my RIZR Z3!.So far Cingular has been a breath of fresh air.It worked for two weeks and than sto working .They then said that this SIM card too was not correct  they would have to send me another one!I ve completely verified by other means that everything on my end (computer phone USB connection etc.)Only issuesMy experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!
1,They sound kind of tinny.Igo Keyboard.Downloaded a couple mp3s to the phone in a flash.The ear clip should be redesigned.This fixes all the problems.
0,This was my first bluetooth headset ever and I got it because I wanted to be able to print out a picture so my headset could match my outfit.Worst ever.
1,!Of course I did experience call drops during long duration calls.It s comfortable and easy to use.Returned my Cingular 8525.2.50 per ringtone.Eventually it gets into place and it s great.The other things is that the jawbone looks fragile.I am very happy
1,I ve had no trouble accessing the Internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.
0,Bought this blu tooth to replace another that was uncomfortable.It fits the razr quite well.After reading the first review I emailed customer service to find out of the description was accurate BEFORE I ordered.Hence we would not be able to apply any credits against the roaming charges.A camera I might play around with when bored.The rest of the time I am around big cities and strong digital network presence.This version was brand new in box.I m still a little salty about spending nearly a day and $10 at UPS to fix this problem.Brilliant but flawed.The motorola branded usb cable which shipped with the software was malformed at the mini USB end and would not fit the phone s usb port easily.I just started using the phone for wmv playback since my iPod broke.I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying   what?  
0,The battery life is highly unacceptable.
0,broken in one month.all of these fees they charge us subscribers are draining our finances.That company is a joke.
1,Finally got my first bluetooth headset settled on this after to numerous great reviews.I had a Motorola H500 that was ok but very loose fitting.I don t get any complaints from the people at the other end of the phone call anymore and it has a good volume level that I can hear at my end.It is return only and if you get a family plan it is return both phones only you cannot exchange and their customer service is very poor.Kit includes two tools needed to open iPod case.My company recently switched from the Blackberry platform to Windows Mobile.It does everything the description said it would.
0,Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.
1,It works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.
0,I was not expecting an OEM life but in less than 6 weeks the battery began to lose holding a charge.Out of 5 different phones I have had this is the best.Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re set wiping out all my data.
0,I was a little skeptical about this product until I acutally tried it for myself.cell phone battery.And I only tried one way.It came with 3 different sets of ear buds but the length of the wrap around piece cannot be changed.WELL....I ve got 9month old twins a three year old a husband(!The only thing I didn t like is that the clip assembly fell apart in two days.$89.00 is the low end of these types of phones but I think the phone works very well for the price.quick shipping~!you got your money s worth...just buy the real one saves you a headacheGot another type with one ear piece with soft plug and it much better.Looks better than it works.I like the shape of it as opposed to the rectangular headsets.i don t yet know if this charger will fit as i have yet to receive it.Now I m glad I did.Voice Quality Signal Strength Dropped Calls.
1,Mahalo and good luck with your seach for the perfect combo in your area.It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it s not.
1,I took my time.Better than expected.
0,It feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.
1,For years I ve used a Palm for that purpose and I don t see anything in PhoneTools that supports Palm.Battery is holding up well.
0,This is 4 dollars Radio Shack is 40 bux You choose.. The Greyhound bus company lost my brothers Motorola cell phone charger.flaky products.Also difficult to put on.I d recommend avoiding this product.
0,I only used it two days and it wasn t always easy to hear with.
0,I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.
0,The first pair I got were really tight on my head and maybe that is why they broke in the first place.Do not use this holster unless you want to lose your cell phone.Sprint   terrible customer service.
1,Since I have a power inverter I have the tiny charging cradle hardwired to the car and therein lies the quirkProtect your expensive meter and it will last.The noise cancellation feature really works better than they admit.If you intend to buy a phone from them get the least expensive plan first.It s a Nokia and nobody makes a phone quite a well as they do.Things I don t like:1.Linked to my phone without effort.
1,THey are so cool!
1,If want to use the fantastic feature of Wi Fi capability of this phone without a data plan DON T DO IT.Easy to use.
1,Better Than New.
0,Phone Charger Needed.Both channels were really quiet and the sound came out mono.Back to square one....What possesed me to get this junk I have no idea...
0,To get the phone in takes some doing at least to get it in right!Piece of trash.
1,The fit is just fine and it s easy to forget you even have it on.Not bad for $6.I work at a day care so there are always children trying to touch it.It works best inside a vehicle with the windows closed.A pretty good product.
1,This is a great phone!.
1,I went to resellerratings website and discovered how horribly they are doing buisness in this country.i changed the preferences to leave it backlit while in use and have not seen very much drain on the battery but the phone does get pretty warm.There is a chance that these ear gels wont fit your ear but for the price they cost it is worth the gamble.For the price on Amazon it is an excellent product which I would highly recommend.
1,Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they re doing.
0,The real killer is the volume and of course it breaking.
1,Easy to set upSupertooth Light Bluetooth Handsfree Speakerphone Black   093744Those phones are working just fine now.
1,I am more than happy with this product.
0,I have yet to even try the bluetooth.It s now 3 27 and the skin is no where to be found.Poor Construction.
0,Not Bad but could be better.Replacement battery.. It s been a month so far of use and so far so good.Why did I buy this phone?It does sometimes get a little static depending on where I am.I could see it even with the phone turned off.Won t stay put.I had an LG for 4 years and loved it.I have dropped it many times  still works.This is infuriating.
1,But other than that I have no complaints so far.thw wire is very fragile and loss of sound due to bad wire connectionAt least it is inexpensive.It was a pain to try to turn on the headset and then get it on my ear.Comments like   doesn t hold a charge   or   it doesn t let you know when to recharge the batteries   are totally false!But the major problem w  this phone is that after a year or in my case 8 months the sliding mechanism gives out.Poor quality.. I believe the headset is a fake    not a Plantronics.Overall I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.
0,Sprint charges for this service.
0,It is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap.
1,It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.
0,It doesn t work in Europe or Asia.
1,clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent s up and coming.
1,They sent me a sim card after I received an email to contact the sales dept.I keep mine tucked into the case and very seldom use the ear phone port attachment.I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.
1,I have always bought cheap earpieces because they seem to last at least 6 months before I have to replace them which is fine.Expected this one to be just as easy to install and delightful to use.I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.
0,the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.
0,the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.
0,Poor product.
0,However I needed some better instructions.
0,You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
1,Well I was a little upset but figured I must have done something wrong.Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).
0,She said   they (Sprint) don t tell you that  .It is also an mp3 player a digital camera and camcorder with a 1.3 megapixel lense.Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens which come in a three pack.
0,It works but.DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS
1,This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.
0,Plus I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.
1,I purchased this item on the idea that it comes with the main piece and the right side.Couldn t say no thank you.All the other cases I ve tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.
0,If you get yourself a 100 m bluetooth adapter then u can roam around in your house and talk and hear music and even be coonected to your cellphone.The sound quality is fairly awful also.. but I m not sure if T Mobile is to blame or if the phone is just really bad.What are you all talking about?.This device is kinda like the Honda Accord.Very Dissapointing Performance.
0,Don t make the same mistake that I did and please don t buy this phone.
0,This phone might well be the worst I ve ever had in any brand.
0,Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.
1,I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones mp3 players in the family.
0,Don t bother   go to the store.
1,**Give a good sound quality compare to its price.I will love it if it does not give an auto reverse problem to me!My husband and I switched companies to at&t so that he could get an i phone and I decided to get a new phone too.I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the Fire Red and it s a great color!
1,I bought this case about a month ago and found it to meet my needs.Both phone and charger work fine.I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.
0,Finally I was excited about this model because I thought it would work well with my Motorola phone.He still thanks me once in a while.You get what you pay for I guess.
1,Not only did the software do a great job of this I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.
1,im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there s not much reviews about it.
1,These are fabulous!
0,I ve bought another brand as well so we ll see which holds up the longest.However BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.
1,I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.
0,I had the bt250 last year and it was fine.I have always had cases for my cell phones because they do protect the valuable phone.I was so skeptical to spend so much money on a cell phone.Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.
0,Performed awful    muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.
1,Very wind resistant.
0,No problems.Obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for.
1,Good sound but.... Really good sound and anatomy but it s hard to connect to Nokia Nseries (N82 N95 N73) that are the best cellphones with A2DP.My experience was rather random.They do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.
0,I contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if I couldn t produce my receipt I was out of luck.
0,I m not one to trade in phones twice a year and I know how to take care of stuff to make it last.Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!
1,USB Cable plus software.It s possible my device is DOA.Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.
1,Great phone.
0,When I placed my treo into the case not only was it NOT snug but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.
1,I m pleased.
0,Battery is terrible.
1,This model the C150 is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered.Do not order from Accessoryone.The shinny keypad gets scratched pretty easy.Bottomline:This is the best phone with T Mobile s 1 year contract.I found the product to be easy to set up and use.
0,The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.
0,Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.
0,The charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work.
1,compare it to the included nokia earpiece!No ear loop needed it s tiny and the sound is great.
0,Finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.
1,I use my phone a lot between calls and texts and listening to the iTunes its unbelievable that I only really have to charge it once a day.I write   intended   because I kept the old battery and now I just rotate them.The handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the Treo reboots.Overall I still rate this device high.
0,Talk about USELESS customer service.
0,It felt too light and   tinny.  .
0,This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.
1,I m happy about this purchase  good quality and low price.
1,I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.
1,Its well designed and very sharp    the blue is a very nice color.
1,Does everything it should and more.
0,I could not recommend these more.
1,Nice Sound.
0,Looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment!!
1,So glad I didnt pay for this at an att or walmart as they are about $20 there.Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
1,Setup went very smoothly.
0,its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.
0,A must study for anyone interested in the   worst sins   of industrial design.
0,I bought from accessory one the total cost was about $4.The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.
1,It is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip.
0,The little part where you press the buttons to choose the station is super sensitive.I didn t buy into the Razor fad when it first came out.If you have to switch the meter leads (black on red; red on black) to obtain a normal voltage reading then the solar collector is wired backwards.Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.
0,I live in an rural area and my calls drop constantly.Can t upload ringtones from a third party.
0,Bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.
0,This phone is HOT!Truly awful.
1,It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the worn out battery did.
1,The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).
0,And none of the tones is acceptable.
0,camera color balance is AWFUL.
0,The Nokia E62 has a 2.5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory.it fits the phone on the side so that s a little goofy but you still have functionality when it s plugged in.This product is clearly not ready for prime time I don t care how cool it looks if you can t tell a call is coming in it s worthless.
1,I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!
0,Chinese Forgeries Abound!.
1,Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.
0,The instructions didn t explain that a microphone jack could be used.
0,I ended up going back to my old phone which is almost 2 years old... but a much nicer handset.i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.
0,Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!
1,The CellSuit is completely custom fitted for this particular phone and...well...fits like you know what.The phone has PCS web access.Works well.
0,Sure it would if I paid a fortune for shipping but then getting it cheaper on this site would have it s purpose defeated.The nokia CA 42 USB cable did not work with my phone.
1,Clear crisp sound.
1,I was so excited to receive this as the battery I got with my Treo 680 was dying so quickly.20 Amps max fuse in back option to plug into existing port in the car or hard wire it for permanent installation.I have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well.
0,The biggest complaint I have is the battery drains superfast.
0,The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
0,Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.
1,The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.
0,It s really intended to be a personal organizer.The unit itself feels quite sturdy but keep in mind it has a quite large LCD screen.The distance is about 30 feet.After using this stylus the orginal will fit looser in the Treo.It doesn t make you look cool.
1,connects quickly and reliably but when i use it with my pocket pc it conflicts with my stowaway mouse causing it to intermittently disconnect.Because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all.
1,I have a whole list and can go on and on.I didn t hear from them after that.Comfortable fit   you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day.
0,Also the phone doesn t seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.
1,You can t beat the price on these.
1,On my phone this button activates the camera phone feature.* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash SOS signals (seriously!
1,lightweight and works well.
0,So just beware.
1,)One thing about the MotorolasI love this cable   it allows me to connect any mini USB device to my PC.
0,So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
1,I too bought this phone ( sprint) when old contract other crappy company ( very badThis is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.
0,Phone went through power cycles when I pushed the send button trying to call people.I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.
1,Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.
0,However the fit for me is not snug because I wear spectacles otherwise it works well.Can t store anything but phone numbers to SIM.
0,Who would have guessed??.It lasts less than 3o minutes if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.
0,Poor quality.
1,I mean come on for 30 some bucks what could you expect right?jabra ear gels   R   the best!.
0,Not worth it.
0,Almost As Good As the Original LG Battery.The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
1,It quit working after I d used it for about 18 months so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I ve ever owned.
0,Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac external battery wall outlet etc).
1,It was a great phone.
0,It is just what I orderedif you simply want a small flip phone    look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.
1,Good value works fine   power via USB car or wall outlet.
1,The same was true with my Samsung.My phone doesn t slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.
1,This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!
0,This is it!Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!
1,The new one did the same thing.In the span of an hour I had two people exclaim   Whoa   is that the new phone on TV?!?
1,In hindsight that would have been a nice feature.I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.
1,After 2 weeks it has loosened up and is more user friendly.This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100  functional.
1,It says Brand new OEM but it lasted for few hours and now this battery is similar to my old one.Other than that the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.
1,It has everything I need and I couldn t ask for more.
0,After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.
1,I bought two ear pieces for my 8260 phone.This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.
0,After 4 days of not being able to connect to the internet I had to go out and buy a Novatel pc card.Motorola Cell Stick.Good product to address a design problem.None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.
1,T Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.
1,The tuner card inserts fairly easily and snaps in reassuringly but you re unlikely to actually pick up any stations.Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.
0,The case fit perfectly and was very thin compared to other cases I looked at.We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros
1,Provides good protection and looks classy too.
1,I got this phone for christmas.I did get it to work by placing the antenna outside where the signal was marginal but would support a normal phone connection.Nice Product Poor Quality.This mount is actually great for the first two days.You have to have it directly over your mouth in order for others to hear you.The good things end there!Krussel Always good.
1,A 1GB microSD card costs about $25.  Ships with mono headphone jack (not 2 ear headphones)  Non standard headphone jack.The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc.
1,The design is very good.4.
1,After scratching for a few minutes the gunk went away.I only tried using it out of curiousity because of some other reviews.I great reception all the time.
1,The phone eh not the best but with the speakerphone or hands free it s fine.I will never be without my Sidekick again!I would highly recommend this product.
0,Couldn t use the unit with sunglasses not good in Texas!
0,It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.
0,Great PDA Bad Phone.Had to get it from Samsung website.Bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing.
0,For the record I m using the smallest gel.If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you!
1,Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
0,stay away from this store be careful.
1,BR50 Motorola Cell Phone Battery.This BlueAnt Supertooth hands free phone speaker is AWESOME.
0,So nice in fact my dog decided it was a better chew toy than phone case.Let me sum it all up right nowI have been using my new Plantronics Explorer 330 for about 2 weeks and am satisfied but not ecstatic.Does not fit.
1,You can find the authentic for the same price..... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.
1,It is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.
0,disappointing.
1,Blue Ant is easy to use.
1,Since that is about the length of the wires connecting the two devices options for placement on the desktop become limited.Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.
0,The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I d rather be using a disposable then this.
0,Very comfortable after adjustment.3.Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.
1,The headset worked well one of the 10 times that I tried it.While the Sony headphones are not immune to wind noise the sound level from the wind is much lower than with the S9.GPS+phone gprs+whifi+bluetooth+windows mobile 5+..... everythink included in term of needed functionality.Not bad for the cost.It s very convenient and simple to use   gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.
0,The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.
1,It was a little more expensive than I thought it should be for the basic features it has but I decided to give it a chance.The sound quality is excellent as well.
1,Its the best headset I have used.
0,NO ADAPTERS.This is the exact same battery that Palm installs in the Treo when you purchase it.Would not reccommend.
1,They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti glare screen protector that I have found to date.
1,And No Camera (Who needs a camera on a cellphone anyway?Just what I wanted.
0,This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.
0,wont work right or atleast for me.
0,in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
0,I have used the phone extensively since I replaced the old battery.But now that it is   out of warranty   the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.
0,I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for me.The good
1,So now they are sending me a new phone sinces its still on its warranty.Great product.
1,The only thing that keeps it from being perfect in my eyes is that it is not long enough.Crisp and Clear.
0,AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.
0,VERY cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor.
0,I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones I have not had this problem.
1,The reception has been generally good.
1,Excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.
1,Great bluetooth!.
1,I use it for my zune and my camera.I highly recommend this case.
1,I ve been using a silver RAZR for 2 months and here are my conclusions:THE BAD:  BROKE!!WORTHWHILE.
1,I actually own a 720i which is almost the same phone.Now my follow up emails go unresponded.This is a great deal.
0,yet.If you value programs software on a cellphone this is probably not what you re looking for (go for Nokia as far as I know).Upon closer examination I found that the date marked on the   new   battery was 3 years ago.After my phone got to be about a year old it s been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.
0,Sick of CDs nothing good on the radio plus my normal day consists of 1.5 hours of driving.I am sorry I made this purchase.
0,I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.
0,Plantronics Battery.Treo and T Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.
0,Really difficult to find and keep a comfortable   sweet spot.  2.It was horrible!.
0,It feels like a brick in those cases.I had not had a cell phone for about 2 years.I don t think it would hold it too securly on your belt.
0,I don t think it is any worse than any other visor mounted hands free device.Great Phone but Horrible Service.This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.
0,They work about 2 weeks then break.
1,As the title says.It is simple to use and I like it.
1,Prior to owning the Razr I owned a Sidekick II and was a t mobile customer.It s a great tool for entertainment communication and data management.Oh be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!
0,I actually tossed my high dollar jaw bone for this one.The replacement set Amazon sent had the same problem which I decided to fix with super glue.I can t use this case because the smell is disgusting.
0,NOT WHAT I WANTED.
1,I own 2 of these cases and would order another.
1,Installed on Audiovox XV6600.For example when you miss a call you usually want to know WHO called and THEN check voicemail.Great Phone.
1,There is no thin strap to wear down nor clasp that unfastens.The only problem I found with this phone is that it has a really poor camera and tiny screen.Phone doesn t matter if carrier s service is atrocious.I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I m very happy with my purchase.
0,The internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked.
1,It seems that the unit can be over charged.Recently got rid of my smart phone after realizing I really didn t need it and picked up this Ericsson.Is it worth the money?Regardless of whether I end up with something that works satisfactorily I wish I had not purchased this product.We tried the phone contact it was down with heavy traffic or involved a long wait.Perfect for the PS3.
1,Five star Plus plus.
1,A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn t hear me.
0,$50 Down the drain.
0,I have only had this product for 2 weeks now so I haven t had time to abuse it but so far it has been great!The warning on the box tells you that if you open the box you can t return it.This software is useless if it won t connect to the phone.I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn t great.
1,This crazy phone will frequently go from full scale signal to dropping a call while standing in one place.I have repeatedly done Master Resets with no luck.It had static everywhere on every station.Good  works fine.
1,For the price this was a great deal.
1,Unfortunately it doesn t)Voice Quality   I think the HS820 works better with the 6230 than V551.I530 AWEFUL!!!!.Great price too!
0,It looks bulky and heavy but the unit is very light.No matter how much time I charge it I can t get more than a few hours of run time from it.The K1m Locks up for no reason without any warning at all.It did not even look new when I received it.If there is a wind it is completely useless.
1,Once the CS50 ones break (which will be soon) I will be replacing them all with the CS 55!Yes it s shiny on front side   and I love it!
0,Does Not Work.
0,It s not the phone because the old battery lasts for days.That was the only reason.Phone comes with Windows Mobile 5 but is not the most recent build date????I admit   it was a gamble.At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44 until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).
1,I HAD to have this phone and now I hate it.The reception through this headset is excellent.
1,2 thumbs up to this seller
1,) and Nintendo DS Lite (This tip also powers the Garmin Nuvi).Great idea but still far away from a perfect BT headset.Arrived faily quick.Well AMAZON you can start hereThe second time (dumb me!Phones usually dont last me more than 6 months!I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.
0,Improper description.... I had to return it.
1,#1 It Works   #2 It is Comfortable.
1,Battery charge life is quite long.
1,I would suggest ordering a case the shiny black outershell just seems like it may scratch easily.There about 6 of us using them at work every day.The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.
0,Battery has no life.
0,but here s the thingI checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.
1,The screen on the front of the phone is always dark and in the sunlight you cant see anything on either.Stereo Headphone Adaptor.The   hands free   HF820 was highly recommended by the Motorola sales person after I purchased my new KRZR phone from US Cellular.Product is exactly as described.
1,Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won t.
0,Another great feature is that you can change the appearance of the numbers that display while dialing a phone number.Thanks Verizon!Works but has major flaws.The battery ships with a wrong door that actually blocks the built in camera.The others ultimately ended up in non salvageable condition.This particular case is well made better than some of the others I ve used.After all that including the waiting I was informed it was not in stock.It folds up nicely and fits in a shirt pocket without being obtrusive.Easy to use.Press twice to redial the last number you called.The phone itself failed after about 10 months.Worth every bit of the $2.97 that I paid for this thing.Other than that one complaint I think the Treo is a real step forward.They were not super helpful.Doesn t do the job.
1,I would recommend it.
1,Plan on ordering from them again and again.
1,That being said for a phone the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well.
1,I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.
1,I cannot put it in my cargo pants pocket and have continuous connection.I don t know how well it works for devices that take proprietary chargers (like the Motorola Q phone or those mentioned by other reviewers).The side buttons provide quick access to use both the camera and the phone itself.I love the functionality of the Treo 650 because I can do school business personal and other things all on one product.ConsSo I am not in a position to compare.if that was there this review would have five stars.Still the enclosed USB cable is quite useful.Rapid Home Charger For Sony Ericsson.Have a 1 00 s.f.They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I ve had numerous Palms too).
0,I m sure by this time next year or sooner the minor annoyances will be fixed and a slimmer lighter device will be on the market.The Treo has neither.I am pleased with the product packaging and shipping.Awkward to use and unreliable.
1,andf when your not charging your Kindle Fire you can plug it so you never lose it!This unit didn t do it s job at all.So far the headset got knocked off only once   through no fault of the device.We argued about the color and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white silver red and black.The keypad is sealed so no dirt can get into it which is a huge plus.The shipping time was also very quick!
0,I do have to hand it to Virgin.Luckily the research paid off and she loves it and more importantly actually uses this headset.Not as good as I had hoped.
1,I have not had difficulty with two problems that other reviewers have encountered.I d really recommend TuneTalk for use in a classroom.I m waiting axiously for tuesday to roll around so i can get my new phone.That does not impede its asset of being both sych and power in one unit.It has such a weird delayed reaction!Terrific build quality great menus and a slim form make user friendly in every sense.Good case!.
0,I would reccomend this phone to pretty much anyone who wants a camera phone.Good Hype but weak on usability.I have mine set on loud since I use a half hlemet and my wife prefers the lower volume in her full helmet.This is not set up for the Motorola V365.I prefer it over wearing a bluetooth in my ear by a long shot.I found this headset at a loves travel stop.Doesn t Work.
1,I should have noticed by the fact thet both packages were closed with scotch tape.Really good product.
0,I ve emailed ccmaccessories twice and yet I still have not gotten word back.Ordered from SF Planet for under $10 including shipping recieved from across the country in three days amazing deal.And looks cool doing it.I forgot I can last a whole day on a single charge easy with a new battery.In addition it works great with turn by turn voice navigation via phone GPS feature.Your chose.God Bless you all!Go to Immanuels Temple Community Church ITCC in Lansing ichigan.Cheap poorly manufactured headphones.The product I received was really bad.Recently my phone has been powering down for no reason and I can t start it back up until I pull the battery.Did not work for me.The accessories it comes with are also improved though they are tan...a little odd.Second the negatives.I love the bumpered corners.Use it intermittently for 5 weeks.When you finally do get the clip to let go it almost always   snags   on the battery compartment button.Press the wrong button whoops you re on the internet.Well worth the small additional cost overall.I ve been using my clip for about two months.I bought another generic brand one and it s still going strong 8 months after purchase.But that s just me.Don t buy this one!Set up was easy.Cool Funky Phone Works Great Awesome quality.BlueAnt X3.These batteries were a piece of crap.The fit is too tight at new.Internet and instant messaging9.Hmmmm... anyway geat price.For the price it was worth a shot and at least I got the car charger to fit.This phone is junk.Alot of headsets are BT 1.1 or 1.2.The only downside I found is that you can t go through more than one wall or you lose the signal strength (1 story 2700 sq ft).This has many features.It will drop calls with all the bars showing people are constantly saying   What?!?The only issue that I have with it is that it doesn t sit very snugly in the ear but it stays fairly well.Couple of calls to customer service and for a couple of days it worked.Love the phone  hate the screen repairs.5 motorola bluetooth headsets.I got my V551 direct from Cingular for $150.00.Sometimes it wouldn t start or charge (and this had nothing to do with batteries or setting).Generic Cable as the other reviews state.Moto battery review.they are just about the only cases that consistently fit well are not bulky or ugly.Except for if i am not using the built in push to talk this makes the button on the side very annoying.The cable works fine.I want to use up my minutes and BURN THIS PHONE!So here I stand.I HAVE THE MOTOROLO RAZR AND RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS HEADSET.It is comfortable to wear.This one is an imitation knockoff.I got the carrying case for Xmas lost the phone on January 10.I priced it so that I could replace it and the cost was way too much.The quality of the sound the craftsmanship and the return refund policy definitely makes this product not worth the money.She was so excited she had been looking for a phone charm but couldn t find anything that she liked.It gave my palm pilot a very classy and elegant look.Unfortunately it did not work.
0,Needless to say I didn t like the way it made me sound to other people that I was talking to.$118 PLUS MY COST SENDING IT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!The sound quality was wonderful.In some stores it is not even available.LG Standard Battery.I am happy to say I have not had any problems with the second.This product is a heaven sent compared to those two.First the Ear bud is included free with the phone.Well i finally got it The FIRST thing they told me isThe screen is much clearer than previous versions a wonderful toy!!!The necessity of a Y adapter just denotes a bad original design.All three broke within two months of use.
0,I use this headset exclusively for gaming on the PS3.Is it a knock off?Great Nextel service pretty good phone.worked great for awhile but burned itself up within a couple of months.I have also become pretty good at putting it on with one hand.I don t know how I lived without one for so long!Good value.I have had the Motorola Razr V3 for 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it.Nice unit for the price.As soon as I activated the RAZR they immediately noticed a great improvement.It got so bad that they credited me $80 or so equivalent to one month of the service I signed up for.dont buy it.
0,My father has the V265 and the battery is dying.
0,I tried 4 other cords and sure enough the phone wont even register that they are plugged in.I think it s the exact battery that came with the Treo a 3 4 years ago.For those of you looking for a headset for 24 7 use seriously don t buy a headset that costs less than $20.My equipment is a Nokia 6225 I have 2 PC with Windows 2000 Professional (SP4) and Windows XP Pro and both don t works .However the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.
0,After a week of researching all the bluetooth car kit options; I decided to go with the simple approach.The calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.
0,No light on cradle didn t charge my Treo.I doubt mine will be in one piece for much longer.Won t stay on your belt.Plantronics wireless.My theory is that to keep their prices down Logitech has had to skimp on the materials and quality.Horrible horrible protector.
0,And there are a bunch of rebate offers right now.I don t use my phone much but I m having to recharge this battery every other day.I have a samsung sync a707.Better than my other bluetooth a Plantronics 320.Overall it is a simple slick phone with a strong battery life.I don t like this Nokia either.
0,I m back to using my 1 year old battery it holds a charge longer then the new one.Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.
0,Had to go to Fry s to get one that worked.I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.
0,The phone had to be replaced.We use a couple different cases to carry our very compact Canon Powershot camera and have never had the camera escape.The original that came with the phone offers no protection and is hard to get the phone on and off.It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.
0,Since then I ve gone through enough phones to realize just how much I loved my D&G RAZR V3i.Stay away if you have small ear canals.the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!
0,Good thing I did nt spend alot of money on this product.Should have had better info from the phone company.Not your fault.Verizon salesperson says this is due to   poor handling   on our part.Works great with Jawbone Era.It is not the best looking but the design distributes the weight evenly across your entire ear not just the top.S9 Bluetooth Headphones.It s a cell phone battery.I bought it a week ago.I hardly use my phone for crying out loud!DELIVERY was GREAT!Why can t Motorola make one for the V600 like they did for the T720?Great for the price.Or if you re trying to dig it out of your pocket you accidentally hang up or ignore the call.This headset has no volume control.I guess it works fine in this capacity   but is just too flimsy for everday use.As previous reviewers have mentioned it gets to be a chore to carry around a PDA iPod cell phone camera etc.Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.
0,But Im not impressed at all.... and the camera is VGA....yikes!Activation was simple and done over the web.If you want an extra FREE 100 minutes send me an email at ajstudio@alaska.com.3 in 1 USB Travel Kit for Palm Treo 650.Excellent Product.Product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.
0,Very positive experience.While my music device was playing in made a very loud noise inside the tape deck of my used car.Accidently detroyed my previous cell.Product works as described by Amazon and product seller.Bluetooth sounds weird as a delay and the battery is always going dead.It s sturdy and it works.I can t even use that side of the phone anymore.I will say that those are a challenge*The memory could be better but it isn t a big deal so far.It s not what it says it is.
0,Very impressive!.I am not going to speak bad about their customer service because they tried.Good product at a good price.Works perfect with my PS3.I recently   upgraded   from a Sony Ericsson T610 to the Moto RAZR.It was exactly what I got as described in the ad and works very well.Thank you Amazon.Best phone I have Used.The additional BlackBerry Data Plan requirement just so I can text is garbage.6.Overall though I would recommend this headset if you are looking for a wireless.Search is over!.I like the phone but I m still waiting for my rebate after a year.the housing is slightly split and the prongs escaped the housing but it still charges!This was a perfect fit for my phone.So if you want to look like a total geek nerd with a giant Treo extending 2 3 inches from your waist this is definitely the clip for you.The camera on the phone is pretty good nothing to complain about there and it also has a 4x zoom which is really cool.I didn t want two devices anymore just one.Stay Away From the Q!.
0,These batteries are getting harder and harder to find.Used and dirty.
0,I have used this for about a month now and have absolutely no complaints.I ve seen pictures of how they re supposed to fit    I guess the back of the headpiece is supposed to sit on your neck.Beyond that there were three included (separate) sets of directions on how to link the unit correctly.ear piece  headset.I have put a request in to Motorola s website for assistance but after two days they have not answered.They claimed that T Mobile needed more info to enter a new account.I use it with my Tuffbook at home because the rubberized keys make typing difficult.There s actually a list of the contents on one end of the box.Very unreliable service from T mobile !
0,You ll be much happier with it.I will never buy another brand again.Of course the sound quality is cassette quality but this product cost me only $7 so it s an excellent deal.Even with the hook still falls off easy.It is comfortable.I really liked how it fit my ear and sounded.When your battery dies you might as well buy a new phone.Not good enough for the price.
0,It does not seem to hold a charge very strongly.It takes 4 hrs.When you access a new menu for instance office tools the phone takes a while to go into that menu.I haven t used all of the features yet but the voice quality is great on both ends.fairly useless item.This unit worked great...for the 1st two weeks of regular use.It was not   unlocked   yet.I had the battery for just over a week and it is already holding a much reduced charge!This phone made me giggle with shear joy.Not a mil spec phone.eforcity battery purchase.This makes it hard to use the computer and make the phone stay connected to the computer.another lousy product.No significant improvement over the old one.Best price around!!I bought two of them and neither will charge.
1,It looks very nice.
1,i love the fact that the phone has sooo many great features and it works great but when it s dropped or turned off the screen will blank out.This is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phone s auto answer.
1,In other words beware that this is a disposable product!Its belt clip is very secured.Please note that NiteIze also makes a version of Clip Case Plus for PDAs Smartphones.I have read other s reviews here but I haven t had any problem with it.
0,This required me to insert it again.These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.
1,Comfortable in my hand.
0,Just does not work.
0,Poor Reliability.
1,One thing that bothered me was it kind of hurt my ear after setting for a few hours but HECK the quailty of the headset made up for that.My wife s cell phone charger broke and we had difficulty finding this particular charger locally.(It works!)
0,If I take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing.
0,when putting in AA batteries it s a bit of a tight fit but i guess this is to hold them in place.Terrible product and waste of money!
0,Last time buying from you.
0,It was a waste of my money.
1,Great design PATHETIC performance.So far it has worked like a charm.
1,Sometimes I have a hard time hearing the person on the other line but the supertooth makes it easy for me to hear everyone because of the speaker.I have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good.
1,But in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.
1,I took out the battery and let it dry and the next day it still worked and with no problems!Would recommend this item.
1,It s been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.
1,I had to fight with five different support reps to get $15 in express shipping and $20 credit to my account for outage and $35 in minutes.Nice case feels good in your hands.
0,The item received was Counterfeit.
1,They replaced it.Just really good.. So far probably the best BT headset I have ever had.
1,Works fine.
1,With some effort works great at home too!.I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.
1,I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.
1,My sister has one also and she loves it.
1,Good Quality.
0,This is by far the worst purchase I ve made on Amazon.
1,I asked for a refurbished 1999 Audiovox because at least I know I can make and recive calls.Excellent dual purpose headset.
1,Excellent!.
0,Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.
1,I tried a few BT headsets and it came down to the Nokia BH 800 and the Jabra JX10.The new battery keeps its charge and I keep working.Amazon had it.No problems.It seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iPhone inside.
0,The bottowm line...another worthless cheap gimmick from Sprint.
0,Didn t return because I will spend more in S&H than the purchase.Having trouble with volume.
1,The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.
0,I had this phone for 27 days out of 30 and I returned it despite liking all of the phones features.WARNING   DO NOT BUY!!.
1,I am pairing this with my iphone and I could not be happier with it so far.
0,When it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.
0,I was trying to order Cingular Cellphone service from amazon.com.I didn t want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort.
1,Best headset ever!!!.
0,The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that it does in fact charge the phone.Don t trust their website and don t expect any helpful support.
1,It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.
0,The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.
1,Fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips.
1,The two carrying cases were completely different even thought the packaging was the same.Excellent product for the price.
0,Next step will probably be to put it in the circular file.Bad Reception.
0,I will just use rechargeable AA batteries instead.You will be surprised.This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!
1,Do not buy this clip unless you have free phone replacement.It was quite comfortable in the ear.
1,Play the music on your phone first.The unit really needs Wi fi and or bluetooth.Great phone.
0,Don t buy this product   It fails!.
0,It s a hassle to send this cheap thing back and ask for a refund but I will out of principle.I have a android phone so I bought it.Stinker for texting though.... I love my Sync!Think   limited  .What products are it compatible with then I asked?Carol s Review.An Inexpensive Improvement.i can wear it for hours.Moisture would get it and corrode or the display would have lines all through it or be completely blank.cable to your phone.I returned the item and will try to find another.my only complaint is that cardo does not include the silicone ear piece in the box.Everything about this product is wrong.First
1,I would use this product when I road my bike.The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
0,This was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts.
0,Terrible phone holder.
1,Mine has even gotten wet a few times & still works great.Then only real annoyance is how bright the LED is.I use the pack every day under my coat orjust strapped around my waist.The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.
1,I love being able to use one headset for both by land line and cell.
0,Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.
0,The second model was a Treo 600 which I bought 15 months ago.When I told him there was already one on it he didn t believe me!Read my review on this hard case!Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
1,I returned it for replacement from Amazon and that was a good experience.I received cable in timely order and then downloaded software from Samsung.But despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.
0,How stupid is that?
1,Before my oem battery would barely last me a phone call before going empty.Its original charger was broken so I would like to buy a charger to replace that.I need to charge it daily even after I set the packet data to   when needed  .I can hear while I m driving in the car and usually don t even have to put it on it s loudest setting.
1,Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.
1,Every time I put it in it hits the buttons on the side and sets off voice commands or turns it to speakerphone.Good show Samsung.
1,So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.
0,She did look into cingular and found out that they had roll over minutes which sprint did not and decided that should would switch to cingular.I ended up getting the Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco which has been the best so far.EL STYLUS QUE ENVIARON NO ES EL QUE APARCE EN LA FOTO.ESTE ESTYLUS NO ES PARA EL HTC 9100 o clicking no losing connections.It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.
0,Couldn t figure it out
0,My phone sounded OK ( not great   OK) but my wife s phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn t understand a word being said on it.
0,I wonder if it is bulletproof?So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.
0,While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.
1,I used a clean cotton cloth (none were included as stated in the description).Shipping USPS was an issue USPS lost the item during shipping but seller IMMEDIATELY replaced item and shipped right away.Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.
1,It was extremely quiet.Works for me.
0,Saggy floppy piece of junk.
1,The software is from Fido and the battery cover is Cingular branded.. so weird.much better than the hard plastic cases.
0,But this is probably true for other headsets too.Kept in the car.Motorola Razr V3 phone review.It also had a new problem.
1,Happy so far!.
1,Did not stay.cool phone.
1,Be careful how seriously you take these reviews.Works good.
1,However the description says do not use on screens with a coating.This one was recommended for my Panasonic cordless phone by Jabra.Top Up Problems.Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.
0,So I was able to pull the headphones out and stick a cassete adapter and use the MP3 player in my car.It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.
1,If you won t be using the Nokia headset much try your luck with it but don t say I didn t warn you...but it is great i would really recommend it
0,Headset H500 PROJECT RED.Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I m not wearing it.
0,There is not too much that can be said about a cable.U can also downloadAs I said above....PRETTY USELESS!
0,How long it will last is an open question.Never got it!!!!!
0,Bought this as a replacement charger.I don t drive much and used this for maybe a month and a half.This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound wise.
0,A couple hundred more to buy a micro SD card to hold more than 12 songs.[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!
0,You ask them questions and they get answered.Same thing happened here I found out that when I turned it on it automatically went into active mode not standby mode.The earpiece has a red light flashing.When I check my account on their website it asks me to register my credit card for auto top up even though I already have done that.The stickers that are used to pull the plastic sheets apart do not come off and you can t see the screen.Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.
1,You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off.  
0,Its ok to have this at this price rate.However after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn t receive and place calls.
0,I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.
1,If the phone is open you must press then star (*) key and hold it for 2 seconds.THEY ARE NOT ALL THE SAME.Bad choice.... The Motorola v710 is an amazing piece of work... to look at.This is the SAME Holster that came with the Blackberry... It s definately the best value out there!The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.
1,Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.
1,I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside.
1,A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.
1,I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.
0,this is my 3rd purchase from Krussel.The mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low.
0,I m returning them.
0,I decided I wanted as much signal as I could get so I ordered and installed the directional antenna.I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.
1,It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.
1,I ve been very disappointed by other   OEM   batteries that I ve purchased on other sites.I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.
1,Otherwise easy to install and use clear sound.
1,nice leather.
0,Now I have to go and buy Roxio or Garage Band for Mac.It is a shell game.The key might be to use your thumb on the inside of the head piece so you can control the pressure on the talk and noise button.I will use this until I find a better replacement.I had this phone at one time for quite awhile.I had to purchase a different case.
1,So I just want to know if anyone had signed up for a 2 year contact but no phone.(never knew that before)it helps keep your phone from roaming.It s also designed to be placed face in to protect the screen whereas the others were not.It is a joy to use.
0,It might be great if it fits your face.Very much disappointed with this company.
1,This takes only a couple of grabs to get used to.Both phones seemed to have equal (and very good) sound quality.The bottom line isDoes it Never crash?After many hours of screwing around installing and uninstalling the software I ve given up.Very satisifed with that.
0,The phone itself had a couple minor scuffs on the front and the small sheet of glass over the camera lens was cracked.People who had trouble with their IPAQs may do well to learn a little more about them.It didn t charge for me.
1,It s kind of space agey looking which I hated at first but it s grown on me.This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!
0,Thank god I checked before placing order.I hear them very well also.Buttons are too small.
1,Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.
1,Love it.. Great armband.
1,I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
0,However the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.
1,I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I m pretty happy with that decision.
1,Ordered this on Friday and received it on Monday!I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
1,Recurring appointments are skipped.Also makes it easier to hold on to.
1,i bought this unit after reading many reviews about it and it sounded like exactly what i needed.I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great!
1,I ordered two set of Treo 750 battery.It is kind of a chincy design but I didn t buy the case for the clip so whatever.That version is too big for the at&t; Tilt.It s pretty easy.
0,Note that it does not have a microphone; it is only for listening to music and for that it rocks!I cannot make calls at certain places.
0,however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn t wake up like normal phone does.
1,You can t find this charger in retail store anymore.Beautiful styling though.
0,I definitely don t worry about the iPhone coming loose...if anything it s more difficult to get out of the case.Prosthis does not work for headset.if i hold my phone in my right hand it will sometimes start getting a week signal.I used to have one of these and loved it till it finally wore out.This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.
0,I m trying to return it for a refund.
0,I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.
1,I think I d save money in this way without contracts and plans.Excellent product.
0,Earbud piece breaks easily.
0,Lousy product.
0,This keyboard is discontinued and cannot be used by many devices.Cell Phone Booster.This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it s very ability to be a phone.
1,It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.
1,SWEETEST PHONE!!!
1,: )Oh the charger seems to work fine.
1,It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.
0,Headset does not work with KRZR K1M.... I purchased these to work a KRZR K1M and both sets of headphones did not work.FYI you can take your old and new phone to a Cingular store and they can tansfer your address book over via the SIM card.I don t know how I ever thought corded headsets were great.This headset is great.The color is good.Arrived OK...and it works!Bad Experience Here.Motorola V600 Problems.Just looks fancy other than that.... I got this phone basically for free but even taking that into account I m pretty disappointed with the phone.It is so annoying.The initialization time takes FOREVER!The Q has great functionality and a very well designed keyboard but every single positive attribute of this device is far   far!SideKick 2 is a bad phone.Not enough volume.
0,The razr I have now is the last one I will ever get.Can a return it for a refund or exchange ?I got this headset for my iPhone from the Apple Store.I need to use it some times with a calling card service.Great case..nothing rough about it.Totally cute!.This was simple to pair up even though his phone model wasn t even in the manual.Samsung WEP200.Eraser works.Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory
0,I just purchased Pantronics CS50 USB Wireless Headsetfor VoIP Softphones.The iGo Power product line is a great idea.Therefore its not silent recording.Works very well.A very nice phone bluetooth.. Short and sweet review here.Body Glove makes a great product.I like this phone   the reception is fine and no one has ever complained they can t hear me and I live in NYC one of the noisiest places on earth.I could not get it to connect with any of several phones.The battery for a Motorola Razor is functioning very well and holding a good charge.I recently bought a new cell phone (Sony Ericsson Z520a) with Bluetooth.Overall best phone I ve owned.I did it in 30 seconds with my Blackberry.Fell apart.I would recommend this product if it will be adaptable to your business phone.you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
0,Loud Speakerphone cool external display camera and color.This is one very cool device that has had a significant impact on my productivity.Good price 1 of 2 bad products.Buyer Beware.I looked for it in stores and couldn t find it.don t waste your money.
0,I tried a Motorola phone and it sent a phone number to the car s phonebook (one party at a time).I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.
0,My phone is disconnected and I just wanted to download my contacts to move to my move phone.A co worker has a Motorola Q with Verizon and is impressed with the Wing s features.Left my wall charger in a hotel and wanted a car charger too.The Hype says:  Getting on the Internet is easy with the RAZR V3 as it supports Cingular s GSM based Wireless Internet Express service.once I did that the case was the perfect size and the clip fit perfectly.The others AT&amp;T Lucent Bell etc... all required a corded &quot;dial pack&quot; that attached to the headset itself.I am using a motorola V551 phone and originally got a motorola bluetooth for it and it was terrible.Don t understand the negative reviews.Adapter does not provide enough charging current.
0,I would definetly buy this phone againIt is difficult to hear whoever you are talking to if the case is closed.3.Pretty bootleg.I just rcvd so unable to see if talk time is any better.Every day is new experience.It did not work Price was to good to be true.You say the name then tell it to dial work mobile or home.Then I lost the earpiece.I am more than satisfied with the product and the excellent service.There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best my mistake.
0,Note that my Moto Q just fits in this case.Great Device Lousy Earhook!.I d recommend it to others!Handy Handset Holder!.Excellent product that lives up to its hype.You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.
0,I love the keypad but I hate it!The website still lists it as  in stock  Not a necessary accessory...but.So this will be the 2nd return.However I have been able to pick up the specifics and choose what options I wish (e.g. answering the phone by simply opening it).Call clarity is good and T Mobile s reception at my work location is surprisingly far better than Cingular.rubber cover.I switched the two phones batteries and the same thing happened.It is the only one I have found that is loud enough to be used in something other than a very quite environment.It would be worth every penny had I had to pay for it.I have been using the H700 bluetooth headset for about a week.work very well with my Motorola Q Sprint smart phone.It charges easily and re  pairs with the phone the easiest ever.It lasted a couple of months before the clear vinyl interior portions began to tear awaay from the faux leather external portion of the case.Other than that great little phone.Someone needs to go back to the drawing board at Bodyglove Fellowes.The phone was also powered off from 8:00 PM Saturday night until 8:00 AM Sunday morning as I went to see a film and forgot to turn the phone back on.At first the adapter worked like a charm .Just what i needed!.Remote will not work for LED color change cube.The connector was what I thought is was the price was outstanding and the shipping was quick.Phone falls out easily.
0,I am returning both cables and just paid the bigger bucks to purchase two separate cords from the Sprint store itself.I m going to return it.I took my chance after seeing some bad reviews here.The difference is equal to night and day.Most wonderfulll mobile in the world... BY FAR.I have found out in that mode the bluetooth signal is more sensitive to walls than shear range.This is a nice headset and is a little workhorse as far as I m concerned.Every time I took the phone out I almost disassembled it.Why do I give it 4 stars then?It didn t work people can not hear me when I talk.
0,The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
0,Nice phone not much to complain.Doesn t anyone make a decent bluetooth?.This phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers.I have tried all the ear pieces it came with and I cannot get this thing to stay in my ear for more than 30 seconds.I m really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn t work.
0,That s okay I didn t really need it anyway.I find the Jawbone extremely comfortable and can wear it all day without it bothering me.regulatory.I ve tried all brands of Bluetooth headsets from $20 to the $200 and this hands free is the only one that actually works for me.Painful on the ear.
0,Nice and snug.Lasted one day and then blew up.
0,Fantastic value.Great protection at a great price!.disappointed.
0,Wouldn t let me out of contract without the BBB helping.I recommend getting that also.I would highly recommend these folks.Just what I needed for the cell phone great price and even better service.Top drawer.The talk time is not accurate talked for about 2 to 2 1 2 hours and 7 to 8 standby on 1 charge charged in 2 hours though.I don t understand the negative reviews.Kind of flops around.
0,When connecting it to my iPod nothing would happen.I love the lights that dance to the ringtones!The backlight is great a really nice no nonsense phone.The one shipped with my new phone lasts approximately 12 hours with about 1 hour of talktime before requiring recharging.One touch dialing is very handy for commonly called numbers.The Bad:  Sometimes I talk too much on this phone.Bottom lineThere are better products in the market which are smaller with clear sound and stable on the visor.Not Compatible with E62.So if you want to carry around a slightly thicker version of your PDA and call it a phone then the RAZR is the phone for you.It holds it well enough but only vertically.And the sound quality is excellent with music and movies.My only beef is that it didn t pair with my iPhone when it came out.good brand marginal product.These units have a  low  and  loud  setting with volume up down for the  low  (default) level.I found this siteI placed the phone in my pants pocket around my arm and even a foot in front of my face.records video with audio.I also adore it because it s so thin and a flip!I would love to know if anyone else is having the same experience as I am.Palm HotSync Connector.Though it is bulky to wear with glasses.bait and switch!.Using a Bluetooth headset once paired is easy.I now have the Plantronics Voyager 510 it is the best bluetooth headset I have ever owned.It takes every ounce of my being to not throw it against a wall and watch it explode into a million pieces.For the money I would go a little higher and buy a little better.Absolutely the BEST!.Software Incompatible With Mac!!.I finally was able to control most iPod functions without having to walk all the way to where the stereo system is located.Text Messaging is Fundamental.I highly recommend these!The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
0,But it was cheap so not worth the expense or hassle of returning.I can hear clearly and they can hear me.Then I decide to give it a try here is my feedback !1.Makes it virtually useless as a phone headset.What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.
0,Unfortunately I needed them soon so i had to pay top dollar for them (retail).After all Plantronics was on the frontier of wireless headsets.Buyer beware.Item Does Not Match Picture.
0,The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).
0,No money back on this one.You can not answer calls with the unit never worked once!
